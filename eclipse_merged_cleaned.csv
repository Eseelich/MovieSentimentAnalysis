1iscbbu,Twilight Saga: Eclipse,mdj1tri,2025-02-19 00:26:52,As for the wolf’s not being naked I always just assumed they ran into the forest put their shorts on and ran back out to be with Jacob. Since there were other people there instead of just their pack. In Breaking Dawn Jacob explains that nudity doesn’t bother them but because of Leah they try a little harder to be modest.,Easy-Attitude7196
1iscbbu,Twilight Saga: Eclipse,mdivpnh,2025-02-18 23:54:21,"You could open-hand slap a brick wall and it would hurt but you'd be fine, whereas if you punched it, especially with bad technique, you'd easily break bones. It's about where the force is applied and how much it's concentrated.",20061901
1iscbbu,Twilight Saga: Eclipse,mdj8yh3,2025-02-19 01:04:51,"With half of the bones in his body broken, getting dressed was not a priority, or possible. The movies don't show this, but the books explain that they (try to) undress before the phase, tying their clothes around their ankle with a cord, and then (try to) phase back in the woods where they can dress again really quick.

If I punch a wall it's going to hurt a lot worse than if I slap it.",ExtremeIndividual707
1iscbbu,Twilight Saga: Eclipse,mdjyg41,2025-02-19 03:28:40,"Actually, in the books, Jacob was still in wolf form until they got back to his house. They couldn’t get him to phase back because of the pain he was in, but they couldn’t treat him in wolf form because Carlisle is a human doctor, not a vet. Charlie was talking to Bella afterwards and was saying that he heard a lot of howling from a wolf while at Billy’s, and then it turned into a string of cuss words as they brought Jacob in. I like to think that Charlie figured that out after finding out the truth about Jacob. 

The books don’t actually touch on the other wolves having clothes on, I think. If I remember correctly, Bella doesn’t get to the field until after Jacob is injured. The other wolves must’ve very quickly put clothes on though. They couldn’t exactly walk through La Push naked, so they had to put clothes on at some point. Doing it while they were still in the field made the most sense.",muaddict071537
1iscbbu,Twilight Saga: Eclipse,mdj2ntx,2025-02-19 00:31:16,"I guess Jacob was too injured to dress, while the others were able to quickly pull their shorts on.

Slapping and punching are very different. It is very easy to break your hand when punching, especially if you have bad form – [boxer’s fractures](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/boxers-fracture) are very much a thing, and why you often see boxers and other fighters wrapping their hands before a match or practice. Slapping, however, distributes the force of the hit better, sort of like how spreading yourself out flat makes you fall slower when skydiving.",meumixer
1iscbbu,Twilight Saga: Eclipse,mdjjn53,2025-02-19 02:03:13,I haven’t seen the movie in a while but don’t they show the wolves as humans running out of the forest? I assumed that’s when they were putting their clothes on,Alittlebitalexis08
1iscbbu,Twilight Saga: Eclipse,mdk591z,2025-02-19 04:11:26,"Jacob makes a reference in either New Moon or Eclipse (book), to carrying clothing around as wolf, tied around his leg/ankle. The movies just simply removed the subject as a complication.",

Here's OP, my old account got banned lol.

I absolutely... LOVED Breaking Dawn! The pregnancy plot was amazing and I loved every page which was told through Jacob's perspective, making me like him, but that only made his death sadder to me. Yes, death, because he imprinted on Renesmee. All of his personality traits and previous bonds were cut off, and he might as well be dead if you ask me. (R.I.P. JACOB)

And though the pregnancy plot was the highlight of the book for me, I still enjoyed returning to Bella and see her have fun being a vampire. I couldn't find myself forming an attachment to Renesmee, but she made the book have stakes which I think worked quite nicely. Though it was a little overwhelming when (I think?) 17 different vampires got introduced back to back lol. The Cullen's now actually posing a threat to the Volturi was pretty amazing, and the book ended just fine. No boredom like in New Moon (this book was overflowing with content!) and no godawful moments like in eclipse (except for Jacob's imprinting.)

1hwt8qt,Colorpop’s initail Twilight launch missed the mark by reducing the saga to a green filter....,m64v484,2025-01-08 23:19:01,"I thought the filter was more blue than green! I think the greens are supposed to be reminiscent of Forks, Bella talks so much about how green everything is. But the palettes is quite blue, personally I think the blue filter is so iconic and I know cool toned palettes are harder to come by so I kind of love the launch, I don’t purchase eyeshadows so it’s not for me but I love looking. I do think cool toned palettes tend to get a less enthusiastic reception because not everyone loves them. 

Honestly though your descriptions of the palettes you want are actually fairly close to what I feel we did get! They did do a silver shimmer highlight called vampire skin in the OG launch! 

The cullen themed description you gave is pretty much on par with the Twilight Palette, cool blues, silvers and greys, a sprinkling of neutrals for versatility. 

The wolves and Volturi pretty much are the new moon palette, warm browns and golds, blacks, reds. 

I am very curious where they will go with Eclipse as you said. I think Breaking Dawn could be quite colorful representing Bella’s new life. She mentions so much how rich the colours are I really think they could get creative with it.",handwritinganalyst

The cool filter is also so distinct to that first movie that I feel like Colourpop not honoring that in some way would make zero sense.

Life & Death ended as Twilight *should have*. Edward’s overly dramatic emo breakdown caused New Moon, which resulted in nearly everything else, even coercing Bella into marriage. 

If Bella had turned at the end of Twilight, SM could’ve done a sequel of *vampire* Bella & Edward, with all Cullens included, facing off against Victoria and her army, and it would have been a whole story of Bella as a newborn herself, but just her and Edward. 

I wouldn’t have objected to including a stand-off-ish truce with the werewolves, and an unexpected Jacob as chief (could’ve been awesome, but not my story), and a happy ending with no lopsided love triangle, or vampire-hybrid baby. Just my humble opinion.",

10dyqvo,The twilight saga ends with eclipse,j4pvhtd,2023-01-17 12:55:01,"Yup, Twilight's a trilogy for me. 

The broad majority of Breaking Dawn was copied over from Forever Dawn which was written _before_ New Moon and Eclipse.

That's just a terrible basis for a ""fourth"" book and it shows.

The characters feel regressed and alien, the tone is off, the writing is subpar and the plot is a canon-breaking, contradictory mess. 

Imo Forever Dawn should've at most been released as the AU that it is, not sloppily stitched onto the trilogy.

Luckily, Eclipse is a pretty great ending for the whole thing.

Ties up the main villain of the trilogy, ties up the love (tri)angle, ties up Bella's (in)decision, has just about every main character have some kind of personal growth by the end of it and ends on a bittersweet yet satisfactory and conclusive note. 

Throw in the added context and weight of The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner and the series ends on an absolute _peak_.

Now this is all subjective of course. If you love Breaking Dawn then I love that for you. I wouldn't be so mad about it if I didn't _want_ to love it too. I just don't think I can. Oh well.",Slashycent

Edward is sooooo extra so much of the time if she has to deal with it as a young adult realizing what humanity actually has to offer I don’t think she could do it. At the very least she would’ve put up with it until she was turned and then she would’ve dipped out. A lot of conflict is generated just from the characters being such teenagers all the time, that’s why I always forget Carlisle is supposed to be like 26 because I’m 26 now and would not have been so indulgent of some of the character choices haha. 

It’s nostalgic for me and deep media literacy conversations about twilight is my favorite pastime but it’s definitely the byproduct of an emotionally immature woman who was probably extremely limited in her worldview due to her culture.

I'm actually really thankful for that being public knowledge.

Otherwise I would've forever wondered what the hell had happened to the series.

The film(s) felt off, the book even more so, which was incredibly upsetting since I was really invested in the latter, so I did some research, found out about Forever Dawn and was like: ""Yup, everything makes perfect sense now."" 

It still sucks but at least there's a tangible reason why. 

>if she wanted to release a fourthbook, it couldve been set in the future of like 10 years or something and theyre celebrating bellas 35th birthday and she gives us like an update on her life and how shes doing as a vampire + how she's adjusted the whole cullen clan!

That would've been great as a little epilogue of sorts. Not sure if it could fill a whole book but it wouldn't really need to, in that case. 

A proper fourth book, in my opinion, would've needed to focus intensely on Bella's choice and inner workings. 

She ended Eclipse almost chosing Jacob and having to ask Alice wether or not she was still a vampire in her visions because she wasn't sure about her choice anymore. 

The fourth book would've needed to let her continue down the path of self-reflection and personal growth she had just started to walk on at the end of Eclipse, having her learn to love herself and truly find herself as a person before she made the decision to possibly end her (human) life. 

That, juxtaposed against the persisting threat of the Volturi, who could've grown impatient while also finding out about the Cullens' alliance with the wolves, could've made for a great final conflict without any magical babies or imprints. 

Give Jacob a side plot where he finds peace with himself (and possibly a new mate) and you'd have a golden finale. 

The sad thing is that I'm kind of describing Breaking Dawn minus the pregnancy. 

There's definitely flickers of a good story in there. 

But sadly that story was consumed and replaced by Forever Dawn.",Slashycent

It's left deliberately ambiguous, but I also believe fate is a real and present force in the Twilight universe and you've given a great rundown of its apparent manifestations. Of course there are reasonable in-universe explanations for pretty much everything, and the rest could be chalked up to coincidence, but taken together all of it suggests some power subtly pulling strings. 

You could also add how the other Cullen couples also seem fated to one degree or another, finding their perfect partners through unlikely circumstances. The strongest case IMO is for Alice and Jasper - that she saw him so clearly before she saw anything else points to them being destined to meet and fall in love, like no matter what she did the universe would find a way to bring them together.",20061901

Even barring the whole... Bella is destined to be a vampire and be with Edward and Jacob is destined to >!imprint on Rectangle, causing him to feel like he's in love with Bella!<, I think it's totally understandable that Bella would fall for Jacob in this situation:

-- Jacob is a childhood friend. It's common to develop compulsory feels for your friend. I got a crush on my friend in highschool even though he was obviously gay (closeted at the time)

-- Jacob is a safe, kind person to Bella in the wake of Edward and the Cullens' traumatic abandonment of her. It's a psychological phenomenon for widows (which we can kind of see Bella as) to fall for men close to them, or to be susceptible to love bombing from men--and Jacob certainly love bombs her.

-- Jacob can provide things that Edward can't: Literal warmth and humanity, integration with the local community, and acceptance from Charlie as a partner that he sanctions. It's a tempting match.

-- Just imo, I think Bella and Jacob are cute together... minus his obvious poor behaviors. I like that he goes along with her motorcycle interest without questioning it, whereas we know Edward would disapprove since Bella has literal hallucinations of his censure.

-- Finally, BELLA WANTS THAT KISS. This is more movie canon, but there are several scenes that show Bella clearly desiring Jacob of her own volition. Right or wrong, she's got the thirst. 

Now, whether Bella should have *ACTED* on her feelings is an entirely different question. For as many scenes as there are of Bella lusting after Jacob... I think Edward is unrealistically nonchalant and understanding. Just my take, but I think it's cruel for Bella to lead both herself and Jacob along like she does when she *knows* she's gonna pick Edward. Jacob is clearly a tasty snack for her, but if she wants Edward as a meal, she should be more accountable that her actions will hurt others. But the book never seems to bring that home for Bella; I feel like it almost blames Jacob for his own feelings and portrays Bella as like ""well she couldn't help herself!""

I mean, throwing away your entire human life, love and fate to get yourself killed by a supernatural predator and join his kin shouldn't be a walk in the park, no? 

>what about poor Edward?

What about him? He knows all about this. He knows that he doomed Bella to an early grave, because nothing on this earth can eclipse the supernatural connection that they have, not even Bella's intense, natural love for Jacob, so he let's her indulge in it for a moment, so that she won't spend eternity regretting what could've been. 

He might've even hoped that she does change her mind, but deep down he knew she couldn't. 

Why not let her have it before her death? 

>and ik that Jacob ends up imprinting on bella’s daughter so this is so unnecessary.

If anything, Jacob imprinting was unnecessary.

This was real love. Real, intense, messy love. And while they both hurt each other in the process, they also grew a lot from it. 

The imprint was just a cop-out to avoid any uncomfortable yet infinitely more profound questions about these characters, all while being infinitely uncomfortable in and of itself.

>she should’ve stuck to her words that they were just friends.

Why should she have stuck to something that was revealed to be a delusion? Imagine she somehow figured that out after her death. The eternal regret. We'd have another Rosalie on our hands. 

>i don’t want to move on with this book anymore can someone plz reassure me or smth???

Assure you of what? 

They're gonna ""break up"" in one of the best-written passages of the entire series, Bella's gonna get a spurt of unprecedented character growth, and it'll end with her contently committing to Edward.

That's not how it went.

Their entire relationship in the initial trilogy is driven by real, natural love.

Only the fact they were inseparable again during her pregnancy, after they had already ""broken up"" and decided they couldn't pretend to just be friends anymore, was caused by the impending imprint.

Jacob didn't ""feel like"" he was in love with Bella, he just simply was. 

>I think Edward is unrealistically nonchalant and understanding.

Which is fitting, since Edward is an inherently unrealistic person.

He's not just getting cucked for funzies, he's giving the girl he knows he'll have to kill, which he hates himself for, one last chance to experience her naturally fated love, in the hopes that she might even change her mind because of it.

What is ""cheating"" compared to murder? 

That's how Edward sees it. 

>Just my take, but I think it's cruel for Bella to lead both herself and Jacob along like she does when she knows she's gonna pick Edward. [...] If she wants Edward [...], she should be more accountable that her actions will hurt others. But the book never seems to bring that home for Bella; I feel like it almost blames Jacob for his own feelings and portrays Bella as like ""well she couldn't help herself!""

That's the canon take, really. There's a whole chapter at the end of Eclipse (#27, titled ""Needs"") exploring that, and giving Bella the most self-reflection and character growth she ever gets in the entire series. 

Unfortunately, Breaking Dawn, due to its inherently retconny Forever Dawn roots, walks back on that, and has her play house with her ex-lover again, like nothing happened.

But that's just Breaking Dawn being Breaking Dawn.

All the characters went through a rollercoaster ride for Jacob to just randomly imprint on renesmee. It’s such a huge joke even Jacob doesn’t understand it. If you look at how this actually happened, breaking dawn or forever dawn was actually an epilogue for twilight. SM was then asked to make more books and she got a 4 book deal. So, she already had breaking dawn plot written. She then went on to make new moon and eclipse, and Jacob became a way bigger character than originally intended in the twilight and forever dawn universe. In forever dawn Jacob imprints but him and Bella are just friends, very casual. But SM started to really like Jacob’s character (she talks about this, how he’s one of her favourite characters) and we see this evolution of Jacob and Bella that climaxes in eclipse. Unfortunately, SM has to still defer to forever dawn/ breaking dawn script and Jacob imprints. So it’s just a big joke how Jacob ends up with the same fate, however the characters him and Bella became going into breaking dawn are very different than intended. Anyway, all of this to say that Jacob and Bella were genuinely in love at this time. Bella genuinely considered for a moment there, what her life may be by choosing Jacob and choosing humanity (staying human). But she was always fated to her breaking dawn storyline with baby R, and unfortunately so was Jacob.

I was reading the Illustrated Guide, which has a lot of extra information regarding the saga yesterday, and Meyer was saying that the beginnings are quite open ended and close as the characters make decisions, which is true. 

Though I'm curious about what you mean by this:

>The plots probably have enough holes to be made of swiss cheese. The characters do stupid things.

The books are almost completely different as the films miss a lot of things out, and most of the ""plot holes"" can probably be explained through those.

Lastly, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Most of the people saying they hate it probably have never actually sat down and watched it or given it a chance and I'm glad you have. They're rainy day comfort films for a lot of us.",DeadDeathrocker

Stephanie Meyer captured something that is sadly lacking in our society and I think that is what makes this series so special.  She captured the concepts of caring for family so deeply that one would do anything for them.  She captured a love (between Edward and Bella) so strong that it was unbelievable for many people.  There were comments everywhere about how the story was unbelievable because there was no such thing as a love like that.  ""How could anyone possibly have a love like that?"".  But that's just it, these people were wrong......

I am close to 70 years old now.  My late husband loved this series as much as my son and I did at the time.  He would watch it with us several times before we lost him to a sudden stroke in 2009.

I connect so much to the characters and whenever I watch the movies, I feel very nostalgic and I generally have a great experience. Also, the ending of breaking dawn puts me to tears every time. When Alice has a vision and then the songs start ''all my lovers surround me, like virgins clean today.."", which is a song by  POP ETC. Also the theme song where they feature all the characters and actors. Whenever I watch it now, I just skip the last two parts because I just become emotionally overwhelmed and I'm a guy so that makes me a bit uncomfortable. I think the reason why I connect to this movie so much is that I've always loved the idea of being immortal and having that one person that is willing to do everything and anything to be with you.

e4fmgq,Why Does the Twilight Saga Make Me so Emotional?,fqke4aw,2020-05-14 03:03:02,"hi lol i know this is a very late comment but i would just like to add:)) i’m 14 years old, just turned 14 April 23rd. when twilight came out i was 2 years old. i only first watched it when i was 6 years old. all though i didn’t really understand a thing, it was still my favourite movie. even when i was a little kid. i would watch it everyday for almost a whole year, and every time i would finish the series i would be already so excited to watch it again the next day. i totally forgot about the series until i reached high school. i remember seeing a post about it on Instagram so i decided to watch the whole series in 2 days and when i tell you i balled my eyes out. i balled my eyes out. especially at the end of breaking dawn part 2, when bella and edward are in the field and she showed him a short montage of their story. at first i never knew why i would cry so i would always search up on the internet other people’s reviews and opinions on the whole series. so many people say it’s very emotional for them because they went through a serious heartbreak and think of their past relationship when watching twilight, or in ur case the feeling of never being able to find a edward or jacob (not including the fact that they’re immortal lol). but i’ve never felt a heartbreak before nor someone important in my life leaving. it took me months to try and find out why i would always get to emotional towards the series. i finally found out why.. i miss my childhood. when everything was perfect and i was happy. i know it might sound crazy because it has nothing to do with the twilight series but it has everything to do with me. because when i used to watch the series as a little girl, i was always happy and had nothing to worry about. but now i’m a 14 year old teenager being stressed over getting below a 70% because it could ruin my whole future on who i want to be, even though i really do try my hardest. i know that’s probably the least sad thing ever but i just wanted to say that even if i’m 14 and never experienced heartbreak, we all have a different reason to be emotional on something (in this case the series). i would just also like to add that the whole twilight soundtrack is AMAZING loool:))",xMelonGlamx

And I feel like the people who relate with twilight the most are teenagers (very emotional changes happening during that time), people who feel like they’re the odd one out or people who lack confidence, or maybe everyone really.. When we see someone like bella (clumsy, a bit anti social, going through a lot of emotions where she doesn’t feel content with herself) meet someone perfect like edward, who cares for her and protects her no matter what, and the cullen family who are as sweet and welcoming and protective as Edward. Bella goes through a big evolution where she goes from a uhappy uncontent human girl to a vampire with a family and a mate who unconditionally loves her. Its all most of us really want.. aaanddd the visuals the primal feel, the MUSICC aaah it just makes the twilight saga a complete nostalgic and emotional ride. Also it forms as an escape for us.

I’m biased as a Team Edward book reader first but it’s ultimately because the love triangle aspect was pushed way more by the movie franchise than the books. The movies and their surrounding merch/marketing pushed a narrative that there is a real question of Jacob v.s Edward that IMO basically doesn’t exist in full context of the books. It’s always Edward, even when she tries to imagine herself with Jacob. Her connection with Edward is supposed to be magical and beyond reason, not comparable to her love for Jacob.

And it’s not just the assault in eclipse, though that should be enough, frankly. 

First, saying Jacob is a hormonal teenager isn’t an excuse. Bella VEHEMENTLY tried to push him off of her and he didn’t stop. You don’t need to be 109 to understand what that means. And he apologizes for breaking Bella’s hand, not assaulting her. He never apologizes for that. Not seriously anyways. 

Secondly, as I mentioned in the first paragraph, it’s not just the assault. Eclipse is the same book he threatens to kill himself to get Bella to kiss him. And honestly, it’s not one singular action. It’s his general attitude that he’s better for Bella and every action he takes is directed by that fact. 

Jacob is a terrible friend to Bella. Sure, Edward has his faults. I’m not in any way saying his and Bella’s relationship is the best. But it’s clear by Edward’s actions he actually gives a crap about Bella’s feelings and boundaries, AND opinions, and not just what he thinks is best for her.",stretchedharpy

Ol Stef is a secretly a Calvinist. Bella is predestined to be a vampire. All of the somewhat creeper/stalker vibes Eddie boy gives is because Bella is his fated mate. She’s meant to be with him and he’s meant to be with her. He literally physically can’t stay away from her. He’s overprotective/overbearing because of the mate bond. It’s not meant to be attractive in a normal male, which is clear in Bella’s repulsion on Mike/Tyler’s obsession with her, it’s only “okay” because of the whole mate thing.

Of course, Jacob was toxic but I agree with you that it’s unfair to hyperfocus on his flaws while giving Edward a pass. At the end of the day, Jacob is a character. The worst things he did I’m not sugarcoating, but I’m more inclined to blame on Meyer than him.",selenerosario

Later on, during the ‘Twilight Renaissance,’ I noticed more people were vocally team Edward because they found Jacob imprinting on Rennet unforgivably creepy. I also saw a reframing of Edward’s behaviour as devoted and romantic instead of obsessive. Imo reassessment of Bella as a character focused on her agency, which granted her desire for Edward more weight in interpretation of his actions. Cultural criticism of Twilight in the 2000s/early 2010s interpreted Bella as a blank slate being acted on by Edward, whereas I think fans revisiting the series are actively looking for a more feminist story. I completely love and support these reevaluations and any subsequent transformative approaches to Twilight. But I also wonder if they sometimes gloss over critically interpreting the text that’s there in favour of the text fans wish was there? 

Personally, I’m team Edward now because as much as *I* wanted to be with Jacob when I was a kid, reading Twilight, I agree with the majority that Bella was never that into Jacob. And I almost decided Jacob was my least favourite character on grounds of being a sex pest. However, a Tiktok creator’s (unfortunately, her name escapes me) analysis of Jacob has completely changed my mind. She’s explained that she understands Jacob’s arc as Rasputin’s fated mate as a straight up horror story for Jacob and how his interactions with Bella and Rizzler play into negative racial stereotypes and sexualisation of men of colour. While I, again, love all the ways people are reinterpreting Twilight to be more Feminist and Queer-positive, I’m excited for more anti-racist interpretations.

My perspective is that while he does a lot of questionable things in Eclipse, it doesn’t really seem to match his character. And overall, I just feel like he’s better for Bella.",alliehfish

They definitely grow into something healthy. Another problem I have with team Jacob is that he’s more or less someone she went to while suffering the loss of Edward. A rebound. And Jacob disrespecting her and kissing her against her will has made me lose any want for that relationship. Lastly, the way Jacob ends with Renesme has tainted the Jacob and Bella ship for me. That’s one thing I cannot get over or accept as a genuine healthy thing (though I love making fun of it and it doesn’t stop me from loving twilight ironically and unironically). All in all, I’m team Bella becoming herself and being respected and she eventually gets that with Edward. Regardless, though, Edward was her choice and he was who she always wanted.

",ld1ikv8,2024-07-13 20:45:09,"I think it depends if you read or watch it first. In the books it’s very clear (at least to me) that Jake was a really good friend but didn’t have a chance romantically. I think the Eclipse move also pushed the love triangle more especially in regards to Jacob. They’re relationship is actually pretty different in the books for me. I think you also see more of Jacob’s bad side in the books. For example the forced kiss was way different between the book and movie. Most casual fans I know haven’t really read the books and only really watch the movies while most die hards I know have read the books multiple times. I’m team Edward and also a die hard so a little biased here. 

There’s also a distinction to be made amongst the Team Edward/Team Jacob debate. I know plenty of people who say they are team Jacob for themselves but that when it comes to the love triangle Bella belongs with Edward. 

I think if Bella was more firm and assertive the dynamic between her and Edward would work better. 

The moment I was firmly against Jacob was the forced kiss. That is VERY significant. They are both possessive but the determining factor is Edward never forced himself on Bella and didn’t ever get violent with Mike or Jacob despite hearing their thoughts. His possessiveness was primarily in his thoughts though he did have his moments where he was controlling. Jacob actively knew she did not want to be with him and forced her to kiss him. Seeing her thoughts in the books made this come across worse than it did in the movies. He sexually assaulted her and Charlie’s reaction was not at all appropriate. The whole mountain kiss is something I try not to acknowledge but he coerced her and was very manipulative.",Able_Stomach9049

I’m not a team Edward person and I tend to see more of the stuff that’s a pass for me. But in the spirit of seeing the good and bad in both, not just one or the other, I like that eventually, respects Bella’s friendship with Jacob and is able to put aside the natural instincts of hating him. And I respect that he recognizes that Jacob wasn’t a villain for imprinting on Renesmee. He recognized that it wasn’t something he could help and that it would mean his daughter had even more protection. 

People harp on the fact that Jake kisses Bella against her will. He does. And he sucks for that. There isn’t any excuse to make what he did acceptable. But he more than makes up for his actions in Eclipse. More than. He got his pack to put aside their differences with the vampires to protect her. That’s a huge accomplishment since they’re natural enemies. He then cut himself off from his entire pack, his family, to protect her, even though she didn’t choose him and there was literally nothing for him to gain at that point. She was married, end of. He hated that she was pregnant and not ending it, but he was still there, helping to take care of her while, once again, protecting her. 

It’s just insane to me to see how people refuse to budge on this and hail Edward as perfect and Jacob is the devil. If you’re looking to see any kind of positivity (or just not sheer hatred) toward Jake, this subreddit isn’t it, unfortunately.",BooksandCoffee386

I’m in my twenties, high school wasn’t that long ago and in my job I work with a few teens, they wouldn’t do that.

And where have you been where Jacob has more haters, cause it’s definitely the other way around for me. Edward has more haters and everyone praises Jacob and says that he is better for Bella, when neither are, they both never respected her consent and both thought that they knew better that she did and what she wanted.

Edit: The comment I responded to says, “that while he was wrong for kissing Bella against her will, Jacob more that makes up for through his actions during Eclipse.” That’s why I said that. Because they must’ve forgotten in Eclipse during that mountain scene Jacob implies that he’s going to get himself killed unless Bella gives him a reason for him not to. And while there is no doubt Jacob did a lot of good and was helpful to Bella and the Cullen’s survival, for me that doesn’t make up for what Jacob did to Bella. Just because he saved her life doesn’t to away from the fact that he sexually assaulted the person he calls his best friend nor does it makeup for the fact that he told her he was gonna kill himself if she didn’t give him a reason not to and when she tried he kept telling her it wasn’t good enough.",Weary_Lawfulness4849

That's not just wild, it's straight up false lol. He's the only vampire in existence who's *never* killed a single human being (well, until Bella I guess. But she's still young). I guess maybe if you count the vampires they fought in Eclipse as ""killing people,"" but I mean. They all did that. They had to to defend themselves. And even then it's not like he enjoyed it.

* There will be some from Leah’s perspective also. 

* Someone from Bree Tanners novella will be in it, I forget his name but I think his gift is to repulse people away from him or something. (Fred maybe?)

* The Volturi haven’t forgiven the Cullens for shaming them and this time they will not be so direct in their approach.

jqvhvj,Probably an unpopular opinion but Midnight Sun/ Twilight book and movie are the only entries in the saga that I absolutely adore,gbpnrw4,2020-11-09 12:26:30,"I agree with you. When I was younger, I liked BD the best because it felt the most satisfying. Bella becoming a vampire, neat happy ending, more action (depends how you look at it).

But as I grew older, I could see how BD became more plot driven instead of character driven (which was the magic of the saga, imo). Plus, the prose in BD was practically non existent. 

Eclipse was okay. NM was, as you said, interesting and it was a fresh take on a love story. Still, NM is the slowest and hardest book for me to read. 

I have mixed feelings about NM, Eclipse, and BD. But Twilight and Midnight Sun had the magic the other books do not have. I could see how Twilight was meant to be a standalone book at first.

You just have these two compelling characters falling in love for the first time. But he thirsts for her blood so much. Edward sucking the poison out of Bella in that ballet studio and actually overcoming his thirst was already the climax of the story. He was able to stop bc his love overpowered his thirst. 

With NM, Eclipse, and BD, the world widened. While the story is still about B&E (still pleasurable, of course), it somehow lost some of the magic of falling in love for the first time with this mythical creature who craves her blood. Maybe (I have a hunch) that's also why Edward started feeling like a side character in the next books after Twilight. Bc he already overcame his vampiric instincts when it came to Bella. His main conflict in the first book was already resolved.",hershyness
jqvhvj,Probably an unpopular opinion but Midnight Sun/ Twilight book and movie are the only entries in the saga that I absolutely adore,gbplwey,2020-11-09 11:58:33,"I get where you're coming from with all of it, however, allow me my take on some things there.

1. To me, it would have been slightly out of character had Bella become more confident and idependent during the break up. Not that I wouldn't have been happy for her had that been the case, for her own sake, but as we saw especially in Midnight Sun, Bella is a selfless character. That is one of her main traits, and I'm not surprised she took Edward back so easily. Personally I agree with her there, as she must have also known that Edward will forever beat himself up over this, which I think is a more than fair punishment for all of it.
2. I might have a soft spot for Eclipse, but I actually like how they were acting (it infuriates me greatly to this day, but that makes it interesting). Bella had to make new, mature decisions she didn't have to face before, she was in love with two guys (who are also supernatural beings that are destinied to hate each other) and there were even more death threats on her than usual. I'm not surprised she acted out a bit there. Edward had to face the consequences of leaving Bella for so long (speaking about punishments), and he was a bit of a jealous boy lashing out, which was interesting to see. Personally, I think Edward was the only one who kind of grew and learned from his former mistakes in this book, like trying to keep Bella from Jacob, an idea he abandoned for her sake, but sadly failed to find a healthy middle ground for himself, which suits his character. Eclipse is definitely less fairytale romance, which I like. Our characters are under more stress and act a lot more like the teenagers they are, which is easy to forget.
3. I know people have their problems with Breaking Dawn, particularly Renesmee and Bella's easy newborn time, but hear me out on the latter you mentioned: Bella says of herself that she was ""born to be a vampire"" (and Steph is huge into the whole destiny stuff), and becoming one has always been her ultimate goal. She didn't have extraordinary stand-out traits as a human; clumsy, constantly in danger, she never really saw how brave, kind and caring she is, but when she finally became a vampire, she'd found a life she felt she was ""made"" for and belonged in. I'm not mad Bella didn't have to deal with a difficult newborn time, also considering how well prepared she'd been, contrary to all our other chracters who had no idea what had happened to them when they first woke up after their change. I like to think she deserved it the way it happened.",Loumany

It’s not like Steph hadn’t shown us that newborns can have restraint — we know Carlisle and Rosalie have never drank human blood, so it’s plausible that Bella also has great self control. She was never great at being human so it’s nice to see her excel at being a vampire.

So many of my favourite artists are on the soundtracks: Bon Iver, Paramore, Green Day, Florence + the Machine, Lykke Li, Linkin Park, The Black Keys, Radiohead, Sleeping at Last... so many good bands and artists! 

I think each soundtrack fits each movie and goes with the aesthetic of each really well. New Moon is my favourite, followed by Twilight, then it’s a toss up with the rest, picking and choosing favourites. 

Favourites from each: 
Twilight: Let Me Sign by Rob, Caught Myself by Paramore

New Moon: Roslyn by Bon Iver, Hearing Damage by Thom Yorke 

Eclipse: My Love by Sia, Heavy in Your Arms by Florence + The Machine

Breaking Dawn part 1: Turning Page by Sleeping at Last, Flightless Bird (wedding version) by Iron & Wine

Breaking Dawn part 2: Fire in the Water by Feist, Heart of Stone by Iko

I definitely remember The River Flows in You by Yiruma being Bella’s lullaby to the point where, years ago, I would get them confused in my head. I think I see them both as being her lullaby. Somehow... haha. Maybe the Yiruma one when reading, and the Burwell one for the movies. (The more I reread the books, the more they are separating from the movies in my head, so many small - and some big - things are different.)

Stephenie’s Twilight soundtrack feels very 90s to me and dig it.",pinksamrosey

j3ndqf,The Soundtracks of The Twilight Saga - a retrospective,g7e6zfc,2020-10-02 12:07:38,"I think most can agree that the soundtracks are amazing!! My favourites are probably in order of the movies. The scores are really good too.

I have two favourites from each one which are:

T: Supermassive Black Hole and Decode  
NM: The Violet Hour and Monsters  
E: Chop and Change (amazing opener) and Heavy In Your Arms  
BD1: I Didn't Mean It (I remember the day I first heard it lol) and Sister Rosetta  
BD2: Speak Up and Cover Your Tracks

You can't capture every sensory detail or moment in a 2-hour film. So the movies standing alone without the knowledge of the books are actually good- but once you read them and get how it 'should've gone' there really is no way back. This is why I think the movies got a lot of viewings, but critics didn't like it bc they read the books and couldn't be taken apart from the original expectations. I used to love the movies but after reading the books I just can't anymore lol.

The only way a movie can live up to the books is by making the writer also the director, or atleast a proactive consultant. But of course they have different set of expertise so they can't do both. There will always be changes when interpreting or passing a message. My point is storytelling from a book vs on a screen have differences. Judging a fish because it can't fly, will make the fish look stupid. I think a book critic, shouldn't be a movie critic or vice versa, so there would be less bias.",nicoangelo15

3d1rdb,How would you like to see the Twilight Saga rebooted?,ct11oo8,2015-07-12 21:44:25,"I would be happy with either, but I think a television show of the Twilight universe would be
amazing!  With a tv show, they can flesh out more detail and focus on a variety of plots without it feeling cluttered or rushed.  

While I'd like to see the original cast again, I know that is pretty unlikely.  Hopefully they could get some talented unknown actors then and maintain that indie feel that was so prominent in the first movie.

Make it more dark, focus on the wolves and Volturi more, let us see more of other vampires mentioned (Such as the Denali clan)  and even some humans (Charlie, Bella's friends) as well. 

They could dedicate a season or two to each book, and go on further. Honestly,  I feel it could hit off really well. Then again, a movie might be better as The Vampire Diaries is still going (not a fan of it, but I assume it's pretty popular).

I agree with you about the Denali clan. I'd LOVE a Succubus flashback. 

I also want to see the humans incorporated as well. While in the movies, Eric took over the character of Ben, and it worked, as a book reader it was kind of odd, considering Eric is portrayed as unpopular and unattractive. I'd love to see Lauren to and see Bella working at Newton's.

I liked Rob, but wish they would have went with his look in Goblet of Fire. So Edward, right down to the hair color. 

Loved Ashley Greene as Alice, even though she isn't as short as she is in the books. Loved her Twilight/New Moon look as well. Kellan was the perfect Emmett. Chace Crawford is my Jasper. Alena Shishkova is my Rosalie. 


Charlie Hunnam is my Carlisle. Emmy Rossum is my Esme. 

The wolves were perfect. It's rare that casting is *that* spot on. 

For the Denali sisters, I like Natalie Dormer as Tanya, Elizabeth Olsen as Kate, and Imogen Poots as Irina. Strangely, Enrique Iglesias is my physical model for Eleazar, and I like Sebastian Stan for Garrett. 

Jensen Ackles is my James and Karen Gillian is my Victoria.

I most definitely liked Rob's hair better in these movies than in GoF. I think it fits the face better.

Carlisle constantly praises Edward in his mind as well (as proven in Midnight Sun). Same as Esme. Same as Alice. And Bella always says to Edward how much she believes in him. She believed Edward would save her no matter what. It was part of the plan because she was certain she won't make it as a human.

I used to hate Edward leaving and the depression and basically all of eclipse but i recently found the full understanding on why it HAD to happen. Eclipse is where i don’t think Edward gets the credit he deserves. Man is a vampire he can’t change very easily- especially emotionally and he changes SO MUCH. granted a lot of stuff was genuinely unhealthy, like breaking her car and just completely messed up. but he changed, he grew and he moved on and he acknowledges how hard these things are for her and he makes it easier on her by letting her not try hurt herself to try see her friend. 

I think Bella was unreasonable for a lot of eclipse- wanting to see your friend and Edward’s reaction to that no that’s fair- but bella knowing how interested jacob is in her continuing to visit him and just make things harder on both edward and jacob was just unfair. Edward’s patience is beyond the moon, and honestly agree with you on the marriage thing. i’d have told him that i didn’t want a ceremony but we could get married on paper and maybe in a few years to be more socially acceptable to get married in a celebration. 

I disagree about breaking dawn though. Edward takes the choice away from Bella entirely. there was no ‘this is my body’ ‘i love you though and i don’t want you to die’ conversation, he just made the decision for her and excepted her to follow through with it without even checking with her. I understand how terrifying that would be but honestly the person who deserves a pat on the back was Rosalie. she became the object of mass hate from alice, edward, jasper and carlisle was against her decision too. only people firmly on her side was her husband and her mother. She protected Bella’s choice and watched Bella get everything she ever wanted, knowing she’d never end up getting it. Edward deserved a nice relaxing holiday after that holding his new invulnerable wife and baby though DEFINITELY, because he did need to witness all that and still save her life. Jacob deserved to be murdered for imprinting on his baby 5 seconds after trying to kill it. especially to then claimed he did anything but be passive agressive towards the cullens and grumpy that bella was having edward’s baby throughout her pregnancy. 

Edward deserves WAYY more credit for the twilight thing though- stopping drinking her blood was insanely difficult and yeah he never had that applause, jusf lots of self hatred for bella being in that position to begin with.

Acknowledged) when she definitely should have died, you went through that traumatic birth and your wife essentially died in front of you (he’ll never forget btw), you’ve successfully changed her by really using your brain and without Carlisle’s help in the nick of time.


I can't agree more. Bella should have said something, he kept her alive against all her bad luck, all the enemies they faced and finally against all odds.


Also he had to listen all the thoughts of everyone during Bella's pregnancy, specially Rosalie that wanted a free baby while she was not worrying about Bella's safety (I know Bella asked her to do all that, but anyway it was selfish). Probably most of them were thinking that everything was going to en badly and that Edward would try to kill himself again. 


All that while he was actively trying to find ways to keep her alive after childbirth. He even wanted the process to be painless for her. If he could sleep he would have nightmares for all eternity about the childbirth scene, the CPR and all that.",-FlawlessVictory-

Then there’s the bed in Edward’s room. She was so surprised about it. Like girl, if you’re sleeping over, of course you’re gonna need a bed to sleep in, but she takes the couch, which is… a little weird.
Edward wants to give her the world, and yeah, sure, he’s…. Say the word, guys. Jealous. But who wouldn’t be, if they were in love for the first time, and you left, and someone else had to stitch you up emotionally? You’d be jealous too, I think.

As far as the “sucking venom” scene, I always fear that he won’t be able to stop when I read or watch that scene. It terrifies me even now.

1h5idq9,I don’t think Edward doesn’t get enough credit ,m0cluer,2024-12-04 10:46:24,I think what you say taps into why some of us are frustrated with how easy and perfect vampire life was for Bella. Edward went through so much to protect and preserve her humanity. The least she could do is eat a few humans and not make it look like a wasted effort on his part.,

I think about this all the time too. Bella emotionally cheating throughout Eclipse. It blows my mind how it’s part of her character to constantly try to please others and care for their feelings—except Edward’s. It’s like she never stops to consider how he feels. She spends a whole night crying in his arms over another man. Then there’s that scene after the party where Edward tells her she should stay and rest instead of going to battle training because it’s been such a long day, and her response is, “If you don’t take me, I’ll call Jacob.” Then she goes to the training and flirts with Jacob in front of Edward and his family, completely disregarding his feelings as they “share a moment.” Bella treated Edward terribly, in my opinion. If the roles were reversed, and Edward had a girl best friend who was in love with him and obsessed with breaking them up, Bella would never stand for it.
And then there’s Jacob. He’s still there, like a curse, imprinted on his daughter, no less.

I also completely agree with how Edward doesn’t get enough credit in Breaking Dawn for the birth and Bella’s transformation. He was all alone. The love of his life was literally dying in front of him, and he had to deliver their child—performing a vampire C-section, something that had never been done before. Mind you, Edward had never delivered a baby in his life! Not only was he trying to save Bella’s life, but he was also bringing their child into the world, under the most horrific circumstances. If I could get one more chapter from Edward’s POV after MS,it would absolutely be that birth scene. Imagine all the angst. 

In my headcanon, Carlisle is always telling his friends how his son delivered his granddaughter and turned his singer and wife into a vampire—all by himself—and I picture Edward getting super shy and embarrassed every time Carlisle brings it up, lol.",sscarletwitch7

1h5idq9,I don’t think Edward doesn’t get enough credit ,m09ya8k,2024-12-03 22:40:34,"Alright hold on! I didn’t realize giving your girlfriend gifts is a disrespectful ask. Especially when he respected it and seriously limited the gift giving. It’s obviously one of his love languages. Bella was being RIDICULOUS when it came to gifts. It was borderline rude. Girl if your man wants to give you a gift let him. What’s wrong with you? That was also one of her extremely annoying traits. Her age showed a lot and she didn’t take in that she was being rude. And I’d totally agree about the married at 18 thing if Bella and Edward were in a regular human relationship. Everyone seems to forget that part at particular points. I don’t look at them as regular teenagers because they’re not. Bella is asking to be with him forever and to be like him. he’s saying fine marry me then. That’s most definitely a compromise. You’re saying you love him and no one else and you want to be with him forever and promising yourself to him isn’t the issue and if that’s the only thing he’s asking of you (like ever) then do that for him. She never does anything for him anyway. It always him. I most definitely watched teen mom and never thought they’d last. But the human vampire marriage when you’re already tying yourself to him in every other way isn’t crazy. Her age was the least of it at that point. You’re mature enough to make a big decision like become immortal but being married is where you draw the line? I’m not saying she couldn’t have reservations about it (totally get that given her age) but when you weigh everything out, she was being ridiculous. That whole proposal scene was sad. If I were Edward I would have said forget it. It was hurtful and Edward being Edward he didn’t express it and was trying to contain his excitement. Why would you have to contain your excitement about being engaged? And buying her two cars?…. People buy their wives cars… and paying for college?… why would he be obscenely rich and have his wife or girlfriend in college debt? Like does that sound normal? Bella’s age shows a lot. 

But, yes, agree with you on your next point. I’m not even thinking Bella is the worst for making him go through the traumatic birth. Like it wasn’t supposed to go that way and it had to be done. I think no matter which way you turn it, he’d have to get in there and bite Renesmee out. I just more so mean a good job (from his wife in particular) would have been nice lol.",jessguest

From what I said he needed praise from Bella specifically. Especially in that instance. the things he did was not just a ‘good job’ worthy thing. In MS there should have been a convo from one of his family members to be like you did it. And yeah I know she died in BD. Even more reason to give him his flowers. 

Carlisle, Esme, and Alice all encouraged him in MS for sure. but encouraging someone and giving credit are two different things. Granted they could have and we just don’t know. But What he did wasn’t spoken about enough. It was a really big deal. there’s not enough praise there for sure. And I also stated that they are cleaning up that huge issue but we could have seen some praise from them after that. I also stated that Bella actually did give him credit in the James situation even though she didn’t fully understand what it actually took for him to stop. And I also stated that Twilight/MS is the least of the lack of credit for me. And yeah Bella did think Edward would save her in BD… great and she also thought that with lack of care of what it would take to save her. She had faith in him. Great but did she understand what it took and thanked him for that and empathized with his trauma? Nope. 

I’m not sure how you read my whole rant with an examples for each instance and came to the conclusion that he gets enough credit. He received praise from Carlisle in breaking dawn and Bella in twilight/MS. There are a lot of important things that SM leaves to desired. If you think saying thank you and appreciating a character with extreme low self esteem and is very under appreciated in general for doing almost the impossible out of love is a waste, idk what to tell you. Bella doesn’t just show a lack of appreciation to Edward she dismisses him a lot throughout the saga. To think someone could do something huge and think ‘oh you know what no need to thank him’ and That it’s even a waste of time to write, Is actually insane. James thing was huge and it should have been treated like that. Constantly dismissed and disrespected in Eclipse but still did what he had to do without batting an eye and Bella (his girl)not caring to say anything? Sad. And BD the biggest of them all. Carlisle says his part and that’s all. You don’t think it’s important to show gratitude? You think it would be a waste of time for Bella to have a reflective moment in the last book of the saga about how far there relationship has come and the fact that her and their baby are still alive? and to see all that he’s done for her out of love and hasn’t asked for anything in return? to thank her husband for what he has done?  You think that’s a waste of time? Something that could just be a moment? That’s wild.",jessguest
1h5idq9,I don’t think Edward doesn’t get enough credit ,m09r6id,2024-12-03 22:02:33,"Haha appreciate it! 🥰

And yeah so much growth in Eclipse! His behaviour in the beginning of it was just as bad as Jacob’s but the difference between the two is that Edward (the unchanging one) reflected and changed. And also I’d say he had more right than Jacob to act that way. because of his actual love for her, he wanted her to be genuine in her pick. And yeah Edward’s patience was endless with Bella and Jacob. He literally deserved an award. I also just think the marriage thing was out of character for her. She always has her nose in some romance novel. Why wouldn’t she want to marry her “prince” as she calls him at the end of new moon. I understand the age thing but I’m talking character. 

So for breaking dawn I don’t give Rosalie much props because it wasn’t like it was for Bella. She was doing it for the baby. Fair enough and that’s why Bella asked her. She wanted her to prioritize the baby over all else and I completely understood that and may have even done the same thing. But when I’m saying hats off to Edward I’m not just talking about the pregnancy. I’m probably talking about that least of all for breaking dawn hats off points lol. I’m talking about their over all relationship. From the moment of meeting her he thought she wouldn’t have made it. He didn’t see how it was possible. But he did it. He kept her alive and truly loved her through it all. The birth was very slim but he worked under pressure and saved the love of his life and mother of his child. He was so upset that he’d be taking away from her. He gave her everything. She lost out on nothing and I love that for him. I think in breaking dawn Bella should have had a reflective moment and been like “you did it. We’re on the other side because of you” sounds weird but I feel like even Edward should have had a proud dad moment like wow I did it. I feel like it was necessary. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾. And honestly I really can’t see Edward actually doing something as big as killing their baby without her consent. He’s not ready to live with Bella’s resentment for eternity. So if Rosalie wasn’t there I’m sure renesmee would still be. Glad she protected Bella and wrong on Edward for just assuming Bella wanted to get rid of the baby (not his shining moment but Edward is all about Bella’s wants.

Cause between the Cullens and the wolf pack who hasn’t saved her life? Edward thanks Jacob for taking care of her while he was gone. But does Bella ever thank anyone?? 

Very true about him more than likely having to hear everyone’s negative (or in Rosalie’s case selfish) thoughts during the pregnancy! Didn’t think of that. Just like I recently took in that Jasper was probably not only feeling his own thirst when Bella got that paper cut in NM, but he was probably feeling everyone else’s thirst as well. So that with his already shaky self control couldn’t have been good. 

Yeah! he knew how close she was to death. The fact that he filled a syringe of his venom to inject in her heart because he knew that at that point a bite wouldn’t do it if she was at her last moments is so  heart breaking to me. You can see he was racking his brain with how to keep her alive. You can imagine the guilt he felt with her being pregnant. And Bella gives him nothing.

I’m glad Edward took in Renée’s ways and actually didn’t love her too much. That’s definitely why she took to Edward’s family so much. The stability, being loved and having to give nothing in return, the consistency, sibling, normality (in a way lol). That’s another reason why she took Edward leaving so hard. So  lost all that as well. And as for the bed yeah not sure what she was expecting. And I actually understood why she didn’t want to use it the first night. I think she was mad at him because Alice “kidnapped her” but after he came back from the hunting trip and apologized and that’s when he fixed up and they made up and she was still on the couch. She’s annoying to me at times tbh. Don’t hate her at all but I think she needs to take it down a couple of notches. You’re being bitten into or marrying into (in her case both lol) the family.

She most definitely did emotionally cheat. And the thing is Edward still understood why she felt the way she felt. He gave her WAY too much grace! He needed to set boundaries for sure. Like I understand why you feel the way you feel but you need to be respectful. (I would have said you and him can’t keep it appropriate then we need to rethink this). And I think about that all the time too. Like aren’t you supposed to be this magnificent people pleaser? But she forgets to please the one she supposedly loves the most. And crying in your man’s arms over another man is diabolical. Edward is better than me. Omg yeah the “I’ll call Jacob” comment is crazy. I’m glad she at least acknowledged that it was a low blow. But let’s say that happened. You’re just going to pull up to the training field where your man and his family are with another man?? Like Bella be so fr rn. She’s so insensitive. And Bella would cry every day if Edward had a female friend like that. And yes to Jacob being a forever pest. 

And 100% agree. If she could just even give us an outtake of NM and BD in his POV I’d be forever grateful

I believe if she did, she may not have moved the way she did. Like I mentioned she definitely needed a good unbiased girlfriend. Jacob didn’t make things easy on her whatsoever. There’s a difference between perusing and being cringy. Perusing someone is attractive and being cringy isn’t but this isn’t a team Edward vs team Jacob post so let me stop lol. I typically also give Jacob the he’s young excuse. But yeah she definitely wasn’t fair to either of them. Definitely had inappropriate moments with Jacob that probably led him on a bit when Edward returned. I’ll never get over the hand holding on the beach. I don’t think she should have cut him off (not until he made his feelings completely known to her) because they were really good friends in a time that she really needed him. But she needed to friend zone him properly. But she had feelings for him (acknowledged and understandable. He was there for her through a super vulnerable time) so it was hard for her to cut it off.

You’re right. Renee was too… codependent on Bella, making her grow up and mature before it was time so she could marry Phill and do what she does. I hate that so much!!! I’ve always known that’s why Bella loved Edward’s family. They love her and would do anything for her, without caring what she could give back to them, which is exactly why it was hard for her when they all left. For once, she had stability.
Yes. I get too, that marriage for her parents, didn’t go according to plan. But that’s no reason, imho, for not wanting to resent a man who was born in an era where marriage was concerned.
Yes. Alice kidnapping her for Edward, to some, is seen as a bit much, and it is.

No. I would be a little embarrassed by that myself. But I’m sure if she showed him a decent car and was like I can live with this, he would have gotten that for her. I get she isn’t flashy and gifts are most definitely not her love language but she doesn’t look at things in a mature way all the time. Jacob gets her a gift and Edward isn’t able to give her one.

Him Hiding prices of things and family heirlooms because she’s difficult to give gifts to is actually crazy. She just isn’t aware to how things look. You can still be you and met in the middle.

But when you’re in a relationship, sometimes you have to make compromise. Also, Edward never asked for a big event. He just wanted the marriage. (Though he obviously appreciated the wedding) Bella was the one to be like let’s do it for real (because of Alice’s influence but when all is said and done she was like let’s do it and after she was happy that she did it) it’s the principle of the situation. In retrospect her marrying him isn’t a big deal when you take it in. she wants to be a vampire and live with him forever and she wants him to be the one to change her (which is against his morals btw). And commitment isn’t the issue for her. So, marriage is his price. It’s a compromise. And a good one if you ask me. Sometimes you have to give in and do what your partner wants even if there’s nothing in it for you. It wasn’t against her morals, standards, or values. She was just embarrassed because of her age. Which I do understand but looking at the situation as a whole, he isn’t asking for much. She shouldn’t have been so difficult about it. When it comes to Edward, Bella always ends up getting what she wants so she can give him that without also giving him a hard time.",jessguest

So it wasn’t as if they have gone for a long time without hunting. It was just them all being unexpectedly exposed to blood, Jasper being an empath and feeling their thirst, and all that coupled with Jasper’s less experience with self control was a recipe for disaster. Alice’s visions work in the context of decisions. She can see things coming like accidents and things of that nature but it will be quick if it isn’t decision based. So Bella’s paper cut was an accident. she didn’t decide to cut herself and jasper didn’t decide to attack her. It was all in a split second. Alice probably saw it literally a split second before it happened (making it too late to stop) and Edward saw it in Alice’s head as well a split second too late. It just all happened too fast. Jasper’s self control is probably better than he’s given credit for because in MS I believe he’s all in the car with them as they’re on their way to the hospital and Bella’s blood is being exposed at that point and he’s controlling himself. They’re all just holding their breaths. 

And yes! The syringe wasn’t even enough. he bit all of those major pulse points and I believed he licked them. Sealing the venom in her system. Like he was really thinking there and he had to bite Renesmee out as well. He had a little daddy daughter moment with Renesmee and by the time he looked up Bella was gone. He did all that And he hadn’t hunted for some time at that point and Bella is his singer. Not that’s that the singer part is even that relevant at that point cause he’s grown past it but it’s still his nature. taking all of it in it was no easy task and I hate that Bella doesn’t take that in.",jessguest

It’s tricky for him but more often than not he’s mature because he’s been around and has gained experience. Also want to point out that Bella is his first everything and people (typically) like to spoil their partners in their way and by Bella constantly turning him down, she’s taking that away from him.

It doesn’t make a difference to Bella whether they’re married or not she doesn’t think it changes their relationship. So if one person in a relationship wants something and the other is indifferent towards it so they go with the person who has actually feelings towards it and the other person gets what they want (Edward changing her) that’s called a *drumroll please*  ✨compromise✨ you should have more feelings towards Bella asking Edward to change her when it’s something he’s against.

Bella is saying she wants to become a vampire so she can be with Edward forever. If Edward’s morals and values are marriage and Bella wants to be with him that isn’t a big deal. To Bella it’s a piece of paper to Edward it means something. And she realizes that and that’s why she says yes. It’s a compromise because she’s getting what she wants and she sees that it’s not that big a deal because she loves him either way and compared to what she’s asking it’s not that serious. Even when she was telling Jacob about it she didn’t even finish fully explaining it when Jacob was like yeah I get it. It’s very simple. If she didn’t feel comfortable at all she wouldn’t have done it and Edward would have most definitely not have made her do it. She just didn’t feel good being the centre of attention.

And if she did just do it for his sake GOOD! She does absolutely nothing for him anyway. If you love him and want to be with him forever it shouldn’t make a difference. It’s a relationship and it’s all about give and take. That is a VERY small concession when you’re taking everything in.",jessguest

Also, my friendly reminder that the entire 4 book series is less than 2 years, so between 4 in person visits (Phoenix hospital, Forks but near comatose, Jacksonville with Edward, and Forks for the wedding), frequent emails, frequent phone calls, probably some snail mail of photos (and I think Bella mentions receiving a letter or package from Renee at some point - oh, when she got her college acceptance I think, she couldn’t think what it could be because she’s just gotten something from Renee, but I digress) that’s probably pretty solid contact considering Renee is a newlywed and Phil is either traveling or convalescing for at least half that period.

She basically sends out a psychic command that makes people fall over themselves to do whatever she wants. Her thoughts are basically screaming their way into everyone’s mind and the entire way through the hospital people are tripping over themselves to help and comfort her. She is probably as powerful as Bella pre turning and the potential usefulness is pretty clear. 

I think he’d genuinely be interested in her power by itself but even before Midnight Sun I couldn’t figure out why he didn’t come up with a reason to turn Renee.

Both of them in eclipse do some dodgy things, Edward’s controlling and lies to Bella, breaking apart her car so that she can’t go to see her friend. Jacob sexually assaults her, then blackmails her into making out with him, or he’d kill himself. 

What we’re saying was more SM wrote Edward’s faults as stuff that is at least excusable or forgivable, and writes Jacob’s faults as literally criminal behaviour. We’re not talking about anything here apart from their treatments of Bella. 

Yes the premise of the book and the idea behind what she’s written is good. The concept of choice, fatal attraction vs natural courses.

Edit: You can like Twilight, and prefer Edward all you want with no guilt, no one blames you for liking one character over another. But her “treatment”/writing of Jacob is 100% influenced by her racism and dismissal of the fact that Native Americans, the Quileute tribe, and using werewolves in the way she did cannot be taken out of context from the author. She made him a predator and abusive, and used the cop-out that it’s his “werewolf nature”. Maybe look at things a bit more critically outside of the author’s preferred context. 🤨 People have every right to defend Jacob and the other wolves for her shittiness and prejudices. Twilight is not an infallible work of fiction and to try to “prove” Jacob defenders wrong by only using the author’s intended characterizations, because she herself made him shitty.

Projection is the key word in a lot of people's attitudes towards Jacob. 

But we can't project what we know unto situations we have never been in. Them being wolves and vampires changes the entire dynamic of the narrative. Even though a situation may be similar to one any one of us has been in, the supernatural elements color those situations very differently. they aren't motivated by basic human emotions in the same way we are. 

That there is such depth to these characters, beyond what we are familiar with, is what makes this series amazing. That they are nuanced and deep, reflective and broad, and flawed. Perfect.

Atleast Edward believed that for the major part in MS that they could not be together and he never planned on turning her into a vampire.
It is about how they face difficulties and obstacles and ultimately their love triumphs.
It is clearly mentioned multiple times in the books that Bella never really had a choice. Even in New Moon when she felt he was gone and would never return, she mostly clung to whatever part of him she could. She ended up doing some really stupid stuffs I agree but it did give rise to a domino effect and ultimately brought him back to her.
Jacob was majorly written as as a foil so his characterization is opposite to that of Edward.
Bella specified that she will always choose Edward and he is the one without whom she cannot live.

She made them violent and temperamental but the perfect ‘coincidentally’ white cullens forgivable and redeemable no matter how bad. Not to mention Bella was extremely quick to dismiss and forgive Edward and the cullens for killing people when she first learned about vampires but literally scolded and reprimanded Jacob when she thought he and the wolves killed people even though they were protecting people. Stephanie is not subtle in being racist, she literally has black people who become vampires lose their melanin so they become as close to white as possible. He wasn’t originally ‘supposed’ to be a foil for Edward he was a plot device to get Edward to admit to vampires existing.

You just do not take people with an opposing opinion seriously at all and instead label them as ""trolls and anti's"". That's not a very mature thing to do in my opinion, and it's very disrespectful.

My other problem with this post is that it only talks about Jacob's ""character assassination"" (literally the main topic of this post) very briefly, and 90% of this post is just explaining the basic plot. Like girl (or boy, or bestie ig), we have also read the book. We know what the book is about too 😅

Here's what you wrote about the actual topic.

>C'mon I think yall forgot. This is a supernatural story. You expect the once naive and gentle human character to stay the same after witnessing everything as he knew it change before his eyes in the blink of a day, his whole life and the relationships within it broken and strained in in ways no human could've ever imagined, literally to transform and become something completely outside of himself... Even Bella Swan was a changed person by the ending of the story

That's it? That's your answer? ""Of course all this supernatural stuff would have an effect on him, he's only human"". How does that excuse him forcing himself on Bella twice and even threatening her with his suicide? I'd have rather heard that he was but a 15/16 year old kid that was desperate not to lose the girl he loves...

Not sure how you meant that to come off, but it comes off as a rude and arrogant assumption about folks you don’t know personally.

No, Jacob did not have his character assassinated. Everything that happened was very much in line with who Jacob became and never fully deterred Bella. That’s not character assassination, it’s a character making a choice you don’t like.

That being said SA is hard to read about and must be crushing to have happen with your favorite character. If they want to view that as character assassination, if that’s how it’s best and easiest for them to cope, I don’t see an issue.

No, the crux of the story is that Edward and Bella are drawn to one another but the obstacles to their relationship seem insurmountable. And then in the end love conquers all, which is the theme of every romance.

>It honestly could've went either way

Not as long as Edward was in the picture, no. The only time Bella considered a romantic relationship with Jacob was when Edward was gone, and even then she wasn't sure she could do it because she didn't love him that way. 

>True love was forever lost. The prince was never coming back to kiss me awake from my enchanted sleep. I was not a princess, after all. So what was the fairy-tale protocol for *other* kisses? The mundane kind that didn’t break any spells?

>Maybe it would be easy — like holding his hand or having his arms around me. Maybe it would feel nice. Maybe it wouldn’t feel like a betrayal. Besides, who was I betraying, anyway? Just myself.

>Keeping his eyes on mine, Jacob began to bend his face toward me. And I was still absolutely undecided.

I don't really know what happens in the movies but I do know that even there she says ""Don't make me choose, because it'll be him. It's always been him.""

There had to be a choice in the sense that Bella had to have another option - she couldn't be in any way forced into a relationship with Edward - not in the sense that Bella had to really wrestle with which option she wanted. And she never did. She was sad to have to break Jacob's heart, and she even briefly believed she was actually in love with him too, but she wasn't ever unsure of which choice was right for her.

>Jacob was Bella's soulmate in a reality without monsters and magic

That's something Bella thinks while she's torn up about hurting Jacob. It's not an established truth of the world.

If soulmates exist in the Twilight universe, all evidence points to Edward being Bella's. (e.g. [this post summarises it pretty well imo](https://www.reddit.com/r/twilight/comments/1dqsynz/the_twilight_saga_core_concepts/).) And Reebok being Jacob's I suppose though I can understand ignoring that bit.

Becuause, for one thing, there is no such thing as a world without magic. Saying they would have been together without magic makes as much sense as saying Edward and Bella would have been together if they'd been born at the same time and met as humans.

And it's at least as untrue; it was only because of Edward that Bella and Jacob became friends. Without first meeting Edward, she never would have gotten close to Jacob let alone wanted to go out with someone who could trap her in Washington.

>Edward and the vampires embody the moon - cold, distant ... Edward with his cool demeanor

His what now? Edward is the most passionate character in the series. His love for Bella is exuberant, overflowing, all-consuming. He can't shut up about it. He's always touching Bella, or looking at her when they can't touch, or thinking about her when they're not together.

Yes, Jacob is described as being like the sun ... because he somewhat replaced the light and warmth Bella got from being around Edward. When Edward left, everything seemed cold and dark in his absence. Jacob was a lesser substitute.

>This warm little space made me think of the early days with Jacob, and I remembered how it used to be when he was my replacement sun, the warmth that made my empty life livable. It had been a while since I’d thought of Jake that way

You mention that Edwards faults were forgivable but Jacob’s were not. I think the root of the problem is that SM doesn’t view them that way. Jacob’s pushiness and literal assault of Bella are almost never treated as seriously as they should be in the narrative. Bella gets angry, but forgives him once she realizes she loves him too, which is essentially the books saying he wasn’t wrong to do what he did. Charlie laughs it off, which, if SM viewed Jacob’s actions as seriously as she should, actually feels very out of character to me. Edward is, I feel, appropriately angry, but within the story I think he’s actually intended to be OVERREACTING due to jealousy and overprotectiveness.

2. (What I have choose to think) Because SM clearly feels like these actions are not as bad as they are in reality, they are not true to the real core character of Jacob (or to Charlie, not standing up for Bella) and so you just decide it didn’t really happen 😂. This is how Jacob is still one of my favorite characters. Would he be smug and over confident, jealous, and other negative things? Probably.

First, saying the transformation was out of character is a nonsense statement. The transformation was an external force that occurred of its own volition. For something to be out of character, it would have to be something the character chooses or does. That’s not the case with the transformation. This is the equivalent of telling someone who develops shingles it’s out of character for them.

Second, as I said in the comment you’re replying to, what came after the transformation was a continuation of a pattern of behavior from well beforehand. It escalated logically based on the forces of the transformation.

Third, calling this cheap and lazy is contradictory to the fact it was set up in Twilight and then used continuously throughout the remaining 3 books with it being absolutely essential to the way some stuff plays out (the newborn army fight in Eclipse and the wolves trying to kill ReNameMe in Breaking Dawn).

Last, the transformation was a big important part of Jacob’s character development. He hated himself, what he became and what he learned about his world as a result. Not every wolf is going to be or respond the same, that actually would be boring and lazy writing.

Buuut imprinting on a child (and from what we've seen, there's nothing platonic about it) and staying around, when you know the future, sounds a bit like grooming to me. 

And fair, I mainly blame Meyer for the situation. 

Also even Jacob's comment about quil and Claire was creepy and that was even before he himself imprinted

""Though I did think it sucked that he had a good fourteen years of monk-i-tude ahead of him until Claire was his age—for Quil, at least, it was a good thing werewolves didn’t get older. But even all that time didn’t seem to bother him much.""

Why are you acting like Jacob is in the wrong for feeling exactly the way he does about vampires? You act like he’s supposed to be happy and like the cullens just because Bella does - Bella who is under their spell and clearly can’t see things objectively with how willing she was to put herself in danger with Edward without knowing anything about his restraint in the first book. Stop acting like there’s ANYTHING wrong with Jacob hating the cullens when that’s what he literally should be - their proximity is what caused all of the pain in his tribe with the responsibility of phasing. Jacob is 16 years old not 109 like Edward. Give me a break. In BD he’s forced to be around them; where is your similar distain for the cullens and their outward hate for the wolves too. What excuse do they have? Are the wolves the reason for their existence? (No). Did they encroach on the Cullen territory (no).

1f1stgl,Can we all put the Jacob character assassination theories to bed?,lkbvs10,2024-08-28 12:23:08,"This response is getting in the weeds of what this thread is. How Edward is problematic is unrelated to Jacob’s theorized character assassination.

Boundaries are what you set for yourself and Bella decides when Jacob touches her, she’s going to draw back. Bella tells Jacob she’s not ready and doesn’t feel for Jacob how he feels for her. Jacob keeps pushing anyway. That’s the definition of breaking a boundary which happens in both the books and the movies. It just happens a lot more frequently in the books making movie Jacob seem less shitty in comparison. Not character assassination.

Again, a character doing something you don’t like isn’t character assassination. A character not being portrayed 1:1 as the books isn’t character assassination. Jacob’s character has a steady pattern of behavior through both, he actually does everything he’s accused of and it never serves to destroy how any characters perceive him. That’s simply not character assassination.

This all being said, if you need to believe it’s character assassination, be my guest. You’re well within your rights to continue to believe the theory (as I am to comment on posts on Reddit saying why I believe it’s wrong).",watson0707

She looks like a child, but is not. She’s just waiting 7 years for her body to catch up to her. 

Imprinting is a disgusting concept SMeyer created, and I blame her for the gross dynamics she’s created too. It’s magical slavery that takes away the shifters free will, and creates a situation where the imprintee will more than likely chose the shifter as a romantic partner as it’s unlikely for anyone to turn away from such devotion. And, thanks to the imprint, the shifter cannot say no as they now live, breathe, and die to protect and fulfill the imprintees wants & needs.",Lilith_Mornings

1f1stgl,Can we all put the Jacob character assassination theories to bed?,ll7epc3,2024-09-02 21:02:39,"I would argue that Alice doesn’t consider her feelings, and then gets to know them a bit in BD. Her and Jacob are pretty rude to each other in NM, which is understandable, but then they have a mostly peaceful conversation (if I remember correctly) in Breaking Dawn. 

Edward is slightly different in my opinion. He definitely does not take Bella’s feelings into consideration in the beginning of Eclipse. I mean, it’s one of his character flaws, he always thinks he knows best and rarely ever listens to Bella about what she wants. But then he sees just how much Jacob means to her, and he lightens up, just asks that she’s careful (basically acts like a dad, eugh) and drops her off and picks her up at the treaty line. 

A lot of it is that no one really cares about what other people think until they get to know the other ones themselves. ie. Edward talking to Seth and Jacob in Eclipse, Alice talking to Jacob in BD, Carlisle helping Jacob in Eclipse really softened a bunch of the wolves to Carlisle.

So yes, I agree for the most part, they don’t take Bella’s feelings about the wolves into consideration.",depressednothing

For one thing, yes, the werewolves do encroach the Cullens’ territory. In BD they full-on live on their property. The only time the Cullens encroach on the wolves’ territory is when they’re all chasing Victoria and Emmett accidentally crosses the border. 

Now for their behavior towards the wolves: Edward has disdain and distrust, mostly for fear of Bella being injured (he did not act great in the first half of Eclipse), Carlisle and Esme never show any hostility towards the wolves, in fact they welcome them into their home in BD. Emmett seems ok with them, but he would also be ok if it came to a fight, I believe it’s the same with Jasper. Alice doesn’t like being around them because of her blind spots, but apart from a few interactions with Jacob, she’s very pleasant with them. Rosalie is the only one who outwardly acts like the wolves are the enemy, and is quite hostile to all of them pretty much the whole time.

It looked like the Vampires dipped their faces into a bowl of white flour to make them look otherworldly when they looked just fine in the other movies.

And to top it all off, Bryce Dallas Howard was not a great choice for Victoria; from the wig to the acting to the styling; Rachelle Lefèvre was a much better Victoria.

Outside of a couple of scenes here and there, it was not enjoyable, IMO. The movie is my least favourite in the saga. I'm also not fond of the later movies adopting this Hollywood Blockbuster feel. Catherine Hardwicke may have taken some artistic liberties adaptation-wise, but the first movie had heart and a beautiful atmosphere.

14qkj10,Does ANYONE like Eclipse?,jqqtj1j,2023-07-05 11:32:38,"I love Eclipse. 

It's arguably my favorite installment in the saga and even a flawed movie adaptation can't quite ruin it. 

Now there are a whole bunch of things that the movie botched. 

The wigs sucked (except for Jazz's), Edward looked weird with his sideburns and eyebrows and Jake canonically needed to have longer hair.

It also brushed over too many important character interactions, which the original story thrived off, and both Edward and Jacob feel disserviced by the film. 

Edward's growth just kind of goes under a bit and Jacob comes off as even worse than he is in the book. 

Now, many of Jake's actions in the story are downright inexcusable, but in the book they at least made some kind of sense, in a way. 

For example, him kissing Bella for the first time was not some elaborate ploy where he took her to some pretty place to try and woo her, like in the film, but a messy, rushed and panicked impulse after he had slept through a good chunk of the little time they had left together and she had to leave. 

It doesn't make the act any more acceptable but it shows that Jake was much more of a scrambling, desperate kid than some scheming jock. 

Jake and Bells's complex, tragic relationship could've generally been portrayed better, since it's the heart of the installment.

Especially the ""breakup"" scene at Jake's sickbed, which the entire story builds towards and which is literally where it got its name. 

There's generally a bunch of very poignant scenes and images from the book that the film could've easily adapted but didn't, like Bella falling asleep on wolf-Jake during the nightly training sessions. 

The tent-scene got it pretty right though. That's where the tragic conflict that's palpable all throughout the book really shines through in the film for once. 

And with that, here's the good things. 

The film, from the get go, feels positively blockbuster-y. Riley's turn is a great, suspenseful opening scene. 

The action is peak for the franchise. The fights are gritty and physical, with a real sense of weight and impact and the vampires anatomically feel the most book-accurate, like actual crystalline marble statues, cracking and shattering just right. 

The Volturi-fight in Breaking Dawn Part 2 is an _abysmal_ downgrade from that. That one just felt like a bunch of weightless, computer-generated ragdolls being flung around. 

The final Victoria fight was great.  

I like Bryce's Victoria. She's not quite as skittish and feline as Rachel's portrayal but she's scarier and more imposing which imo fits her role as a vengeful, villainous general in this. She's also a bit closer to the Vic I pictured while reading.

Riley is awesome and so is Bree. Great casting. 

The backstories are an absolute highlight and did the book justice. 

The film also did the meadow scene more justice than the first one. Just beautiful. 

All in all, I'd say the film is about as faithful an adaptation as Hardwicke's first one was. A bunch of changes, some questionable, but overall close enough.

New Moon still reigns supreme though. 

Best book and best, most accurate movie adaption, imo. 

But if I were to just randomly revisit the series on a whim, I'm pretty sure I'd go for Eclipse.",Slashycent

She had no idea about the newborns until much later. So it had to be rewritten from a standpoint where we get to see Riley being changed and Victoria’s army going after the Cullens. But there was so much unnecessary fluff and that film tape could have been spent on giving us more of a backstory about the newborns themselves and especially the true intention of the Volturi and how they threatened Victoria so they could end the Cullen clan. 

Liked: 
the mountain scene, Jacob saying to Edward, “Afterall, I am hotter than you,” the newborn/vampire/werewolf battle, the proposal, the music, I even liked the story of the cold ones and the third wife, though it was much better in the book, Charlie breaking up a near battle between Jacob and Edward after Bella returns home after punching Jacob, the visit to Rene when Bella thinks it’s the last time she’ll see her mother or be able to hug her, loved the quilt made out of trip t-shirts

Disliked: 
Bryce Dallas Howard as Victoria. Thought Rachelle Lefevre was so much better, the engagement ring, that they left out that Bree was actually thinking about the role of the Volturi right before Felix killed her so that Edward would read her mind and know.

For one, it was my first midnight premier in the series. So I have special memories around the experience.


This movie gave us the training scene with Jasper. Very few scenes rank as high for me—across the whole series.


More vampire lore! Newborns! Evil plotting!


The tent scene will never not make me giggle. It's supposed to be tortured and dramatic but I find myself amused.


Rosalie shares her story. I love everything about finally getting her perspective, and that this film gave us other transformation stories so we could see more than just the romanticized version. I love me some complex and horribly scared for unlife Cullens. Plus, Rosalie leaving her horrendous fiance for last so he knew she was coming, and then showing up to finish it in her wedding dress—amazing. 


Bella flipping between frustrated at Edward being controlling and really wanting to bone him was just a whole teenage mood. Fun to watch imo.

That she was thinking how attractive he looked in this one and New Moon. I haven’t read the books in 10+ years so I’m not %100. The look in Edwards eyes when he says that line too and Bella knowing what he was thinking. Then he makes sure to kiss her before leaving.

>And yes!! After his actions eclipse I’m really not a fan of Jacob at all but I think the book does give a better lens to Jacob and more insight to his character than the movie

I think I like Jacob as a character much more than most. 

I do find that Meyer made him go overboard in his desperation, making him a straight up sex offender, which sours the otherwise deeply endearing relationship he had with Bella. 

On the other hand it's kind of the point.

Him and Bella were meant to be together in a 
normal world and the loss of that fate drove him desperate and insane. 

I think one just has to recognize him as the tragic figure/anti-hero he becomes post-NM. 

Not see him as the good kid he used to be, and so desperately, but unsuccessfully, _tried_ to be again in Eclipse. 

He's honestly the most complex and deep character in the entire saga. 

A young man robbed of his natural fate. In many ways he's not so different from Edward. 

I strongly believe that Meyer chose the wrong resolution for him. The answer to his dilemma was not forcing yet another fate he didn't ask for, and had no control over, onto him.

He should've carved out his own path, deciding his own fate for once, if anything, getting with Leah who also lost her love to fate. 

Together they could've learned to live and love again. 

The imprinting storyline takes the tragedy of Jacob's character and _reinforces it_ under the guise of a ""happy ending.""

It's a complete betrayal and punishment of the character, on top of being terribly immoral. 

One of the many reasons I'll never recognize Forever/Breaking Dawn as part of New Moon and Eclipse's continuity. 

But I'm ranting lol. 

What I was trying to say is that there's more to Jacob than meets the eye and both the movies and the fourth installment fail him in that regard.",Slashycent

I’ve never read *Wuthering Heights* but I see your point! That explains why reading the books feels so much like reading individual stories sometimes!

Eclipse specifically though, I remember SM talking about the book cover and its symbolism. She said the ribbon strands are like the last few things holding Bella’s life together, and they’re literal threads. Bella, Edward, Jacob, Victoria, Charlie, and whoever else all have differing plans for Bella’s life. All the important threads pull different directions. Some of them tug similarly, but none of them are exactly the same, and it makes you wonder where the breaking/splitting/life changing moment is going to take us as the audience. The hardest part is that, aside from Victoria’s plan, Bella has to decide. I feel like Eclipse is the pinnacle of that angst. 

Eclipse ultimately becomes hard to read, for me at least, because there are so many things going on in her life that just do not work together, and I think Bella acts out of character for a lot of it.",lilbearcat19

I felt like my frustration peaked with the “love triangle” and main characters in Eclipse, but I keep reminding myself that they’re teenagers. Even though Edward is like 100+ years old, he’s mentally a teenager. Bella is young. Jacob is young and going through a whole weird 2nd puberty. They make stupid decisions and their relationship is over the top, irrational and emotionally difficult to understand at times. They think with their emotions and not with their brains. As much as I don’t like Edward, or even Jacob, as a character at times, it all boils down to their emotional maturity. But honestly maybe that’s the point. Maybe we’re supposed to hate/be annoyed these teenagers and love their relationship and this is just a whole modern Wuthering Heights situtation",

ipauwn,Why Eclipse is so frustrating to read,g4jjalg,2020-09-09 13:03:47,"I've been thinking about Breaking Dawn and I'm not really sure. Obviously Merchant of Venice matches up nicely with the ending like you said. I've also heard Midsummers Night Dream (this one I assume is because of Jacob's sudden significant other switch...) But there's nothing that matches up neatly with Bella and Edward's relationship.

I think this is because most classic love stories end at the wedding whereas that's where Breaking Dawn begins. While perhaps being the most fantastical of the four books, Edward and Bella's relationship is now grounded in ""reality."" There is no more ""will they"" or ""won't they."" They become parents and equal partners. The conflict of the story no longer exists in their relationship, but outside of it.

ipauwn,Why Eclipse is so frustrating to read,g4mu8r9,2020-09-10 07:26:50,"I think for me it was easier to forgive Edward because he knew it was wrong, admitted it and apologized and eventually realized that Bella was truly only *in love* with him. He knew it was his fault that they were so close (leaving her in New Moon) and let her grieve over Jacob and didn’t really get too jealous after that. Jacob on the other hand continued to pursue Bella and try to get her to be with him and kept bad mouthing Edward and kept jabbing at their relationship every chance he got. Then he kissed her and continued to ignore what she wanted and made it all about him and what HE thought was best for Bella. I don’t remember him asking her straight up what she wanted and how she felt. Please correct me if I’m wrong I only recently started re-reading the series and am only on New Moon. So for me that’s basically why I don’t see it as Bella being murdered by Edward. I see it as she wanted that lifestyle and change to be with Edward because she loved him more than anything and wanted to be with him above all else. I understand Jacobs concern but in my opinion he shouldn’t have had a say other than his initial reaction and he should’ve have respected Bella’s wants at the very least. Keep in mind that Edward hated the idea of her becoming a vampire as much as Jacob -slightly different reasons- and tried to talk her out of it throughout the books.

vva3tk,Eclipse is unreadable.,ifmmvtm,2022-07-10 19:00:25,"It's my favorite Twilight book alongside/after New Moon. 

Yeah everyone's acting incredibly toxic in it but it's still  in-character and eventually leads to the most character growth of any book in the entire series, at least for  Edward and Bella. 

Jake never really comes around but to me he's more of a tragic figure than a hero in it. A broken man with a broken heart and a broken bond. Like the book cover. 

Breaking Dawn on the other hand feels like an entirely different series to me and honestly feels even more toxic since everyone just sort of forgets about their growth. 

Bella goes from her hard-earned self-reflection about the damage of her indecision to clinging to Jacob again even though she knows it hurts them both, Jacob goes from relatively gracefully admitting defeat to being abusive and invasive again, Edward is strangely selfish and narrow minded again and everyone just sort of treats Bella like a piece of meat (""puppies""? Seriously?) and tries to force their own agendas onto each other. 

With all its surface level toxicity, Eclipse was ultimately a very wholesome book to me, where a bunch of incompatible and varingly broken people come together with the common goal of protecting Bella and leaving her a choice. 

Breaking Dawn on the other hand is a seemingly fairy tale-esque happy ending but the more you look at it everyone's just acting weirdly selfish, manipulative and at times completely contradictory to their prior development.

Pretty much every bad thing we spend the previous books trying to avoid (from Bella's brutal death, to her not having a choice about turning, to Jacob imprinting) comes true and it's somehow supposed to be a good thing.

1ik452r,Wtf happened with Eclipse?,mbp67w6,2025-02-08 18:24:57,"Well, there are marked differences between all movies because they all had different directors.

Like the jump from Twilight to New Moon wasn't my cup of tea personally. But it was because the director wanted to go with a different feel.

With each movie, we see that the budget gets bigger. Which is pretty common as far as franchises go.

If the CGI isn't to your preference, there could be different director of artists doing it. Like the CGI artists are given ""this how I want it done"" by whoever runs the CGI department, who also collabs with the director to give it the ""proper feel"". Personally I feel like, sometimes, big-budget movies don't always allocate resources intelligently. So even if a movie has a higher budget than the last installment, the CGI department doesn't seem to be the one getting that large cash injection. Its not always like that obviously, but every now and then. Also keep in mind Avatar (the James Cameron version) had just come out and it was pushing the bounds of CGI but not everyone got a James Cameron Budget to pull off good CGI. It was a mind blowing budget everyone talked about him getting to pull it off (for the time).

Side note, the budgets were fairly low until the Breaking Dawn parts IMO:

* **Twilight (2008)**: $37 million
* **New Moon (2009)**: $50 million
* **Eclipse (2010)**: $68 million
* **Breaking Dawn – Part 1 (2011)**: $110 million
* **Breaking Dawn – Part 2 (2012)**: $120 million

whereas things like Pirates of the Caribbean series and Avatar have budgets had:

* **Avatar (2009)**: $237 million
* **Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)**: $140 million
* **Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)**: $225 million
* **Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007)**: $300 million
* **Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011)**: $379 million (most expensive)

Though on critical analysis of the budget jumps between New Moon and Eclipse, it wasn't all that high. And if you look at how little the wolves were shown in New Moon compared to their bumped up presence in Eclipse that was predominantly in wolf form, it probably wasn't high enough to CGI everything. CGIing all the individual hairs and shit, NIGHTMARE. That's how the do Sully's hair in Monster's Ink (2001: $115 million), hand drawn each hair individually. I think I heard that Pixar invented a new software JUST FOR HIS HAIR. And that was before this kind of CGI. I think hair is one of the hardest things to animate and CGI, I remember hearing that long ago. Which is why its so expensive. Why they didn't have Jon Snow interact with his Dire wolf too. So expensive. They're also multiplying the number of wolves and have multiple in multiple scenes. And wolves, like Sully, ARE ALL FREAKING HAIR. You have fight scenes with vampires that also need a little CGI too. That's a lot for a budget that small to handle honestly looking at the budget differences

My honest guess is if you didn't like Eclipse, was probably more a directorial problem than an actual budget. I agree the costuming in Eclipse and New Moon felt questionable. In New Moon I didn't like how they changed the appearance of the Cullens so drastically from Twilight. The color palette I could live with in New Moon, but it was just their appearance that felt too startling. I felt the same issues with Eclipse but preferred the coloring palette more. But this is each director's way of putting their mark on the movie they took charge of. Their style.

But do you actually like the story of Eclipse? That could be also playing a role. Eclipse is my lease favorite story of the four installments So....no surprise I'm not too hot on the movie honestly. Also sucks the OG Victoria couldn't reprise her role but she was great in the TV show she was in.",BloodyWritingBunny

Afterwards i actually found the real blueray, and you are indeed correct about it looking better and more warm. The blueray i posted wasn't the original so i was mistaken.

i really am sorry, i'm not trying to change your opinions

For me it definitely felt like the music, sound effects, editing and general filmaking techniques all contributed to New Moon having more of a soft, Soulemn vibe. And the dialogue probably.

Like you I'm not the biggest eclipse fan. I still really enjoy it though. I like it because there's still tension with Edward and Bella marriage/vampire-ism. The father giving ""the talk"" scene was great. And the proposal scene. etc

For me, 1 strength of the original movie, was how Edward was mostly masculine and Bella was mostly feminine.

It's almost as if, the 'love'/ 'devotion' was indeed there in all the movies. But the first movie had the attraction and the 'draw' to one another, and the polarity between the aggressive man and the entranced girl.

I think my favourite line in the franchise is Bella saying ""why didn't you let the van hit me and save yourself all this guilt"". I found it so compelling and i loved Kristens acting. To me it made Bella come across as young and innocent, but at the same time she wasnt ditsy",Alas-my-children

It would have been different if the following directors had kept the looks for the characters to keep continuity's sake and only changed the vibe. But they didn't. Which...sucks...IMO",BloodyWritingBunny

1ik452r,Wtf happened with Eclipse?,mbsb20f,2025-02-09 04:43:26,"Well I appreciate that. I’m open to opinions. Really am. That has just been an uncomfortable exchange for me.

But your favorite line also is the line that makes me cackle my ass off. It’s such a good line. Stephanie Myers really does have a way with comedy sometimes. Peak teenage statement. For a peak teenage situation.

The reason why I don’t like new moon and eclipse really aren’t that deep beyond what I said in my original comment. Costuming mainly for eclipse. They always break continuity between the movies and directors and that’s what frustrates me. Fashion can change. Style can change. But when I’m talking more like the things that are like hair, color or eye color. The way they do those up change between the movies. Like the Cullens aren’t really supposed to change in my opinion as far as those go. The style of hair can change sure, but the foundation of their appearance was changed. And that Breaks suspension of disbelief for me personally. Like I think a really good example of having Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in the reboot as well. Having him as wolverine throughout this entire X-Men series really helped continuity wise and was really good as they didn’t change Wolverines look. Even as Hugh Jackman got older, my belief was still suspended because of the continuity sustained in the overall appearance and style. Like his fashion style, of course had to change to fit with the times, but the facial hair stayed the same basically. Like yes he sometimes loses the beard, but it’s still reminiscent enough to not pull me out. But for a character like as for example her hair went from strawberry blonde too I don’t know what colors they were using, but they were all dark and that’s such a continuity breaker for me. Same with Rosalie and Carlisle.",BloodyWritingBunny
1ik452r,Wtf happened with Eclipse?,mbsebk2,2025-02-09 05:07:15,"i guess i'm lucky i just don't pick up on details. Although i did notice they looked more obviously ""vampire"" in New moon. Maybe it was how pale they were, eye colour as you say, etc.

Happens in every tv show, movie series. It always becomes more self referencial and clear lines drawn. As an example, In eclipse, ""the party will be fun"" ""you said that last time""

I sympathise/agree with the cackling. And you're correct it feels very teenager and like she's socially/verbally still a bit underdeveloped because she's misreading Edward's coldness.

The trilogy is quite simple and uncomplicated and yet its put me in an existential tailspin regarding my own life, and what i actually want from a partner. lol

thanks anyway, no need to reply if u got nothing left to say. I honestly feel like watching the movies again, but iv'e already seen the trilogy 3 times in 3 weeks and i need to get on with my life lol.

1173xcc,What the heck happened in Eclipse?,j9etigf,2023-02-21 12:10:30,"As for what happened to Bella:

She's trying to bounce back from a depressive episode that damn near killed her, clamoring to everything that makes her feel alive again, even if that means living two lives that are fundamentally incompatible.

She's different after New Moon because the events of New Moon changed her.

Her entire worldview, all of her relationships and even her love for Edward was challenged. 

Jacob saved her life. Now Edward is back. 

And she's somewhere in the middle, traumatized and terrified of losing anyone she cares about ever again.

Of course she's weak. She almost died. 

As someone who went through a very tough time while first reading the series, New Moon and Eclipse are some the most authentic representations of depression and its consequences in modern popular fiction to me. 

They elevate the series from a relatively shallow wish-fulfillment fantasy to a psychologically profound and emotionally resonant bittersweet tragedy.

Unfortunately Breaking Dawn undoes that completely and regresses everything back to pure fantastical wish-fulfillment with little depth. 

It's like Meyer accidentally wrote a much different, in my eyes much _better_, story after putting Forever/Breaking Dawn on ice, only to fall victim to her own self-insert's dilemma and not being able to decide between two wholly incompatible worlds and, unlike her self-insert, fail to make a choice, hurting everyone and herself in the process.",Slashycent

1173xcc,What the heck happened in Eclipse?,j9eq7hu,2023-02-21 11:31:37,">Does it get better with Breaking Dawn?

Absolutely not lmao.

I mean it depends. 

Did you care even remotely for the plot, atmosphere and characterizations built up in the first three installments, especially New Moon and Eclipse? 

Then Breaking Dawn is gonna feel so estranging that it'll make you want to give up on the series entirely.

Did you never care for New Moon and Eclipse whatsoever and just wanted a fanfiction-esque wish-fulfillment fantasy as a direct sequel to the first Twilight? 

Then Breaking Dawn could be made for you. 

It's essentially a completely different story with completely different characters posing as the ones from the last three books. 

Meyer wrote it as a direct sequel to Twilight but it was shelved for its off-puttingly mature and uncharacteristic tone, so Meyer replaced it with the much more relatable and emotionally resonant New Moon and Eclipse. 

Unfortunately she couldn't let go of her old draft and so she stitched it onto the trilogy as a phony ""fourth"" part, no matter how dissonant and nonsensical it was. 

Though your dislike for Eclipse makes me believe that you might actually enjoy it. 

The reason I hate it is that it shits all over New Moon and Eclipse because it wasn't written to be a sequel to them.",Slashycent

1ic69oz,"Eclipse, the sharp rock and the bleeding arm",ma4xx54,2025-01-31 03:38:42,"The wording in the book is vague and can be read as her not cutting it. But Meyer did state in the official guide that Bella **did** end up cutting her arm. I've argued with people on this before and the book definitely is so wafflingly vague that it seems like she's just ready to, and maybe initially that was the intended plan for the book. But by word of god at least, the cut happened.

I always took her gasping to be the result of her cutting, like she gasped because of the pain. The wording does make it read like it could be a gasp in preparation for it. 

The thing that really pushes me more on the side of the cut happening is how Bella hears Edward's exasperated sigh. I don't think he would have sighed just because Victoria was distracted, but because he was like ""Dammit Bella this was entirely unnecessary"".

Though I will say that in any case, I do like the movie version in the sense that it's nice Bella contributes to the fight. Edward was really in a rough spot in the movies but was always in control in the book, as he is perfect of course.

1ic69oz,"Eclipse, the sharp rock and the bleeding arm",m9vqt96,2025-01-29 20:03:16,"Commenter who replied is correct—Twilight is written from Bella’s POV, so when Eddie disappears from her life, she has no idea where he goes. She just knows he’s not at school.

Years later, Smeyer released Midnight Sun, which is the events of Twilight, but from Eddie’s POV rather than Bella’s. When it was released, we found out where he went when he ran away from Bella—he went to Alaska to visit his “cousins,” the Denalis—partly because the Denalis were known to love human men. And he was falling in love with a human girl.

There’s a nice enough scene with Eddie and Tanya, where she’s teasing him about his conundrum and they’re messing around in the snow, just being old friends and old vampires. It’s also revealed that Tanya (one of the origins of the Succubus legend, btw) has basically been flirting with Eddie for years but he has always turned her down.

After they talk, he chooses Bella and returns to her in Forks.

They’re not wrong in wishing that scene had existed in the film, tbh. Can’t blame them for that lol. Imagine the possibilities, like when the Denalis show up at the wedding and meet human Bella. They are obviously very kind to her, as they recognize she’ll be family soon. But think about the extra layer of Tanya the Succubus being part of the reason Eddie and Bella get married to begin with. She’d sort of talked some sense into him, and he’d realized he had never wanted anyone before, but he wanted Bella now and forever.

Ever since midnight sun I’ve maintained the idea that if Tanya didn’t exist, neither would Bedward. Eddie was too stubborn to see he had found his mate.",dictatorenergy

The rest of the movies, as much as I like them, feel more like a studio actually trying to manufacture blockbusters with a lot of choices that feel calculated and entirely practical (i. e. that could result in better profits) and the casting of bryce to me feels as a symptom of that pressure to over polish and micromanage every aspect of the movie to make it blockbuster worthy.",ConferenceFine3454

Whether it was this or the Harry Potters, many people confessed that nothing brought them out of the fictional dream of a movie more than a character's actor changing. It starkly reinforces, ""this is just a role."" By the time they did so, Rachelle Lefevre was quite liked as Victoria. She gave her this very natural, feral-vampire persona and really seemed to live in this character. Bryce (with all love to her) couldn't bring the same spirit and they also chose to give her a rather fake-looking wig.

That being said, I don't have any reason to think that Rachelle wouldn't have been able to do the same thing had they been able to work out the scheduling issues with Eclipse.

Personally the only thing I was slightly disappointed with has nothing to do with either actress. It was more that I didn't feel like Rachelle's hair was red enough in Twilight and I am glad that they changed that for New Moon and Eclipse. I know that seems like a weird thing to get hung up on, but I am a natural redhead so I'm a little bit more nitpicky when it comes to that. Especially when a character is described as having fiery red hair like a flame. And I just didn't feel like Victoria's hair in Twilight was fiery enough.

Summit simply didn't care (rightly so, imo) about anyone beyond the trio. And I think Rachelle ended up being a warning shot to a lot of other castmembers who tried to get cute about their contracts for Breaking Dawn as well. Like Kellan and Ashley specifically, tried to play hard ball and I think found out quick that they were extremely expendable in Summit's eyes.",amara90

He had an obvious crush on Bella, but from reading MS, we see that he’s like “aww ok then” when he realizes she’s with Edward. He still likes Bella, but respects that she has a bf regardless of his father’s prejudice towards him. By NM, he seemed kinda okay in the beginning, but it was clear he was getting impatient with trying to “help” Bella move on. He kept subtly trying to hit on her and push her to see him as an option. It only got worse after he changed. His desire for Bella was fueling his hatred of vampires and it was exhausting that he couldn’t move on from her (I refuse to acknowledge some “pull” he had to her simply because she was carrying an egg that would eventually be his imprint 😒). Obviously Eclipse showed him at his peak shittiness. What small bit of hope I had vanished after that. 

Overall, Jacob was selfish as hell. Regardless of what he felt for Bella, he should’ve learned from Leah’s situation. Why the hell would you still want to start a family with this person when you know there’s always gonna be a possibility, no matter how small, that you’re gonna imprint on someone else. Especially when she knows about imprinting! Like I could see it being different if she didn’t know. You could claim blissful ignorance and pretend that person is your soulmate because they’d never know otherwise. But Bella knows about imprinting and he was just expecting her to be okay with the fact that he could leave her at any moment for someone who’s his literal soulmate.

Bella played with his emotions for so long, they were about to kiss in New Moon but she saw Carlisle's car.

In Jacob's mind, he feels like Bella loves him, just doesn't see it because Edward is in the way.  
Bella being with Edward, aside of the jealousy part, means ""death"" of Bella.  
Jacob is desperate to save Bella from that fate, to yank her from the bloodsucker clutches, if not by force (fighting Edward) then by showing Bella they're also in love.

He believed that Bella had feelings for him and thought that kissing her would make her reciprocate those feelings. While it was indeed assault, Bella felt more annoyed than truly upset by it. Even when she got home after the incident, she didn’t even frame it as an assault to Charlie.

That said this situation is often glossed over because it’s not uncommon for someone to take a chance when they believe feelings are mutual. The outcome can vary because the recipient may welcome the kiss, or they may find it unwelcome.

Many movies and TV shows depict similar scenarios where a character misreads signals and acts on their assumptions, often presenting them as romantic rather than inappropriate. Creating confusion about consent and boundaries, suggesting that taking risks in romance is acceptable even when feelings aren’t mutual.",Meliciouslly

He calls Billy to be like wtf, and Billy uses the excuse that Jacob is tired of being led on by Bella. (Obviously can’t tell Charlie he’s a wolf) Charlie yells at Billy that Bella made it very clear they’re just friends, she doesn’t owe him romance, etc. So just based on that I feel like if Charlie had the full picture he would defend her",twilightinportland

I feel like sex gets pushed so much as this be all end all, even with preteens (which is what I was back when I first read the books) it was good to have a counterbalance to that. I don't think sex before marriage is wrong either and it can definitely be good to know if you're sexually compatible with someone before making such a serious commitment. But I guess it was nice to see a couple that really focused on the romance aspect first, and even more nice to see a dynamic where the *guy* was the one who wanted to wait.

As a girl you get told so much that you have to constantly be on guard because ""guys only want one thing"" and it's your responsibility to put the breaks on that aspect of the relationship if you don't just want to get used for your body, especially back in the 2000's.

1key69o,"What was your first response to the ""No sex before marriage"" exchange in Eclipse and how do you feel about it now?",mqpe0jb,2025-05-05 13:36:59,"I never paid attention to it. Maybe in a secular world, particularly to adults, it seems strange. But you know a lot of teens don't want sex and aren't sex crazed. And you don't even have to be religious about it.

I think looking back, it's a positive representation of men and teenage boys. They aren't all obsessed with sex. I know we say things in jest like ""I couldn't live without sex"" but a lot of teenagers manage to ""live without sex"" well into their collegiate years. It's not strange. It's not wrong. There's NOTHING WRONG with people who don't want to have sex immediately. I think it's a healthy representation. 

It shows girls can want sex badly, and boys may not want it badly. Its fine. Nothing wrong with it IMO.

More importantly, it shows that just because he's a boy doesn't mean you can stomp his boundaries. That entire scene is more than just about sex though. Its about who Edward is.

Its a negotiation. It's not all about Bella. That's important to consider with the context in which this conversation happens.

Bella wants sex before Edward wants it, or rather feels comfortable with it. I hate to do the gender flip thing, but in what world is it appropriate to pressure young girls into sex? Not a good world. Why should we consider it a good world if young girls can pressure young men into sex before they're ready for it? I wouldn't argue that's a good world.

Moreover, it's similar to Bella demanding to be changed into a vampire. Ignoring and not understanding Edward's deeply help belief he is DAMNING HER SOUL. Again, in a secular non-religious world, doesn't seem like a big deal. But again, we also say ""Jesus Christ!"" or ""God damn it!"" without fear of going to hell. When you are raised to believe in Heaven and Hell, those words have a deeper and more important meaning. Just like damning someone's soul to hell. WE CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND unless we've been religious and held the deep-seated fear and belief of the dichotomy of heaven and hell taught to Christians. I was never raised that way. I will never understand how Edward feels, let alone what Stephanie Meyer believes and fears about God and Hell. And let's not forget, in the 19th century, at its turn, he most certainly was raised Christian.

We should not under estimate how deeply held the Cullens believe they have been damned. In many other vampiric representations, vampires are considered things of the devil and monsters because of this. Stephanie Meyer held true to this tradition and belief. 

I often compare this to that scene in Interview with a Vampire where Louis changed Medaliene for Claudia. In that scene Louis says to Claudia, ""and now I die"". Meaning it killed something inside him. It took something left of his humanity in many ways. It's a very dark thing to curse someone to immortality. And this is a theme and common thread between the majority of vampire novels, which Stephanie Meyer drew upon.

In this scene in Eclipse, Bella and Edward are negotiating what she wants and what he wants. Both things Bella wants are completely in opposite to what Edward wants and is comfortable with. In the real world, I think we all would say they are incompatible and they should break up. In Romance Novels, the main couple HAVE to work it out. He asks her to wait until he's comfortable, and where he's comfortable is marriage. We, as readers, don't have to like it, but in the novel,l it worked for them. In this way, we must accept it if not also respect it. Bella gets her sex before she gets to be a vampire and that's really all she wanted. She just wanted sex. 

Bella got to be a vampire, just like she wanted. Stephanie switched it in a way where it wasn't exactly on her own terms but no different than how the rest of the core group of Cullens were changed. To save her life. Rather than taking her life, as Edward would have seen it, he had to make a choice. Save her and damn her for ever to live beside him or...let her die. That's a very different decision than do I bite my wife and forever partner and kill her to be immortal or do I refrain because it is against every fiber of my being. 

So for me, you cannot detangle the sex conversation, which is ultimate temptation, and becoming a vampire.  And both topics are what this scene in Eclipse deal with. Because boundaries are being pushed and tested in ways that Edward doesn't want.",BloodyWritingBunny

He knows she doesn't really want a young marriage, but wants sex, so he kinda tells her its marriage or nothing, even though he's never really told her this before. I get he never thought it was possible before but surely he could have mentioned it that first night they were cuddling in her bed and she brought it up. Hey fyi I'd want to wait till marriage regardless. 

Bella wanted pre-vampire sex afraid she wouldn't enjoy it after, and she kinda married him on that premise with no other option.

Unfortunately it does bring up a lot of what I grew up in with religion and surely S'Meyers goal to have this message. I know that many young kids got married for sex ag my church. I know that's oversimplified and many Christian (or celibate for other reasons) couples have genuine intentions but with many others, it's pretty plain to see when things fail later. Purity culture does breed this. 

Everyone here discusses his boundaries but it really wasn't FULLY mutual. I think Bella felt trapped and figured why not. She even said it was just a piece of paper to her. 

While I think it's nice she respects his boundaries, I do think it's worth mentioning that other facet of this.

I was a young teen with zero religion in my immediate and close family, but thought it should be special and with someone you loved. Waiting until marriage seemed kind of romantic, in the sense that you only wanted to share it with the person you were spending your life with. 

As an adult, I obviously know there were many problems with this. Wanting sex doesn't undermine love, love doesn't require marriage, and sex doesn't even have to be special. Etc. Etc. Etc. 

But for some reason - and I honestly don't know why - there's still some part of me that finds it a bit romantic. Even though I'd think nothing of it had it been written otherwise. Not because I think it's a morally ""superior"" choice, or a demonstration of ""higher love"", or anything like that. I haven't waited until marriage, and as far as I'm concerned the ""right"" choice is whatever an individual wants for themselves. 

But I personally kind of like the idea of doing it with one person you spend your life with! Even though I didn't, and am fine with that. And don't expect anyone else to have to think the same.

I still don’t, honestly. Edward and Bella are both deeply flawed characters who do grow a bit, but sparkleboy had a boundary that he wouldn’t cross for multiple reasons. It was worded a bit dopey in my opinion, but I think that was Meyer trying to hammer home that he comes from a different time. 

Edward is controlling and neurotic while Bella is a human, it’s true, but given the context of the story and (after Midnight Sun) knowing just how ready to roll that dude was, he was trying to be sure she wanted *him*. She had to be turned eventually by edict of the Volturi, but he also wanted her to *choose* to be with him as an individual before he would get intimate, and that was his boundary. 

I also appreciate that Bellas pregnancy was extremely fraught. Granted it was for supernatural reasons, but even a normal pregnancy can have a lot go wrong/be dangerous. It’s fairly rare that we see a pregnancy depicted as being pretty horrid all the way though, in any kind of media, let alone a romance for younger/new adults.",Anomalous_Pulsar

She's out there asking for a bigger commitment than marriage and Edward's condition (of marriage) is a test for her to prove she's ready to be changed. He has to know she won't regret it later. It's also his traditional/formal personality, and a demonstration of profound respect to her. He doesn't want to have sex with her unless he knows without a doubt that she is ready for forever... he already knows shes horny but thats not enough. It would be too hard on both of them for them to do it and then not end up together. Since he's constantly underestimating her love for him, he doesn't fully trust her conviction without a bit of proof. And her commitment in marriage is the proof he needs. 

And finally, a sliver of him doesn't know if he can trust himself to bang her. Maybe he feels better knowing that if she is truly going to be changed, then if they tried having sex as human/vampire and he accidentally went too far, then he knows at least worst case scenario he could change her right then and there.

I was confident in my choice and stuck with it and have been having awesome sex with my husband for twelve years now, but there was a memorable amount of ridicule that came along with it. I know I was not alone in that. So, being the same age as Bella IRL, it felt nice to read about a popular book character who wanted the same thing.

I don't think anything wrong really happened in the book as far as ridicule went. He and Bella had to figure out their own relationship. It's just not a choice that has a whole lot of representation and it was cool as someone who often felt a little isolated in it to have an old vamp on my side.",ExtremeIndividual707

She was both alluring and villainous, without having any speaking parts in New Moon. And her expression at the end of Twilight; you knew she was out for blood (haha). My favorite scene in the film series is from New Moon, when she’s in the forest, with Hearing Damage playing. I think her portrayal was very authentic to the way the character was written in the book series. 

Bryce overacted. I hated her teeth-gnashing and growling. All she delivered was “look at me! I’m a scary monster!” or “I can talk seductively and be PG-13 sexy!”",UnicornPizzle

from what i understand, howard was originally offered the role but it was ""too small of a part"" so she declined so Lefevre took on the role of Victoria. then ig when the franchise got big, im guessing since Howard had connections in hollywood, she just took the role for herself. the franchise say it was because of ""scheduling conflicts"" but i highly doubt that was the reason. howard just had more power and connections in hollywood bc she's a nepo baby and Lefevre was an actress with no connections",Ok_Trade4341

Lmao like she went around acting like she's so above such a role, but then when she realized Twilight was the biggest thing since Harry Potter she came crawling back. And instead of telling her to fuck off they like they should've, the girl who already worked her ass off bringing Victoria to life got fired. Just like that.

There was no scheduling conflict (which honestly wouldn't make sense, they knew how many movies there were going to be, she already signed contracts and agreed to them, it's not like this was written as it went). 

All I know is that the girl they replaced her with was actually offered the role first and turned it down bc it ""wasn't a big enough part"" lol that was the actual reason.. but then with how huge the movies were I assume she changed her mind real quick and I guess decided she wanted the role so instead of telling her no like they should've, they instead just up and fired the girl who already put in the work (and did it beautifully, I might add).

I think this is the perfect example of why I didn’t like her as much as Rachelle Lefevre. In the books, Bella *obessively* described vampires, but also Victoria specifically as being “cat like” and I feel like Rachelle *killed* that in the first two movies. 

In Eclipse, Victoria takes a much more softer “evil” where she seems like she would give you a hug and then stab you in the back. Still great for a super villain but, not at *all* the way book Victoria was described.",TheRudeCactus

* The female with the vivid red hair was tenser than any of us, her body nearly vibrating with anxiety.

* The female was irritated by his introduction; she was almost consumed by the need to escape.

* Carlisle smiled at Laurent, his friendly, open face momentarily disarming even the frightened Victoria.

These are all thoughts Edward thinks regarding to first meeting Victoria. 

She's not as she was portrayed in the twilight movie. Sassy, vicious, or even much of a fighter. Her literal gift is one that makes her find the best escape no matter the situation.

She's not described as catlike. Other than this way.

It's not just her posture, it's her overall effect that caused such a visceral reaction from Bella. Bella sees her as ferocious and wild. There's nothing civilized about Victoria, she's someone out for blood and way past the point of being reasoned with. Vampires who lost their mate are at their most lethal.

ETA: We knew Victoria's true character via Edward's mind reading abilities in MS (published in 2020) and got a more in-depth information from the illustrated guide (published in 2011, a year after Eclipse the movie had premiered). The thing is, we see Victoria through Bella's eyes first and foremost. Whatever is going on inside her does not always match what she projects *externally*. Just as some people would say Robert Pattinson should have been more lighthearted bc Edward outwardly hides his fear from Bella in Twilight despite his anguished narration in MS, that's also my line of reasoning with Victoria's portrayal.

Bella see's her as on edge and shifty. In Eclipse she learns more about her, but that's still not what it was about it was still about how she was portrayed in twilight vs how she truly was. 

That you can't understand that and still stick to the first twilight movie as the best Victoria AFTER copious amounts of information to the contrary, just proves that you're more concerned with being right and preserving your own ego instead of realizing how she was portrayed in twilight was faulty. 

My very first comment pointed out that the only reason you wouldn't see it would be if you hadn't read MS but apparently you have and yet you still stick to this narrative, defending it and calling it ""different perspectives"" when it literally goes against canon for that character. 

It's not about a difference in opinion, Victoria literally doesn't talk until Eclipse. Yet in Twilight the movie, she is being very talkative and even smirks and jokes. A completely different character. :)",

Rachelle was given the script in Twilight and the scriptwriters took creative freedom back in 2008. She had to act out the material given to her. But in New Moon, you can see her being agitated, frustrated with the wolves, and yet still pose enough threat and cunning. She wasn't given dialogue there and New Moon is a way better adaptation than the first movie.

The Twilight saga is told via ""I"" narrator hence the differences in how characters see other characters. Bella is scared straight by Victoria. Reread New Moon and Eclipse, if you want.

Nothing in the series is the objective truth bc it is told in ""I"" narrator. Edward's or Bella's. The Illustrated Guide can be considered as the objective truth. But again, it was published a year after Eclipse came out and Victoria displays a different exterior. Bella was absolutely shocked by her bubble gum voice bc she expects her voice to be sharp and feral. Reread that passage again in Eclipse, if you will.

It may come as a shock to you but some people can actually display things differently from what they really feel inside. And you know what's even more shocking? People can view the same story with different lenses. *Gasp*. I know, right?

Well, according to this sub (*including the mods*) Jacob has the biggest flaw of all, he's a sex offender since he kissed Bella without consent - which is apparently the worst thing anyone has ever done in this entire franchise. So if Stephanie Meyer thinks Jacob has no flaws, that means she supports a sex offender. That's actually pretty interesting.

>I have to put this book down for now cuz edward doesn’t deserve this

Edward left Bella, in the middle of nowhere, absolutely no concern for her safety at all despite knowing that both Victoria and Laurent are out there and could easily find Bella and kill her slowly and painfully - but he doesn't deserve anything bad?

It'll also make you write the two best installments in your series and give it more nuance and depth than you ever originally planned to. 

Twilight would be _nowhere near_ its popularity and success if it had just ended with Forever Dawn.

It would be remembered as that one solid vampire romance book that was ruined by a god-awful sequel about a magic baby and its teenage soulmate. 

I'm not even sure if we would've ever gotten the films in that timeline.

Part of being an artist is taking constructive criticism, and shelving Forever Dawn was the best thing that could've possibly happened to the series. 

It's the last thing the fandom should mourn, especially since the book practically _did_ come out, almost unchanged, in the form of Breaking Dawn, which fundamentally regressed all characters but Jacob back to Twilight-status, and if you skip around the middle part with his POV then even that's not a ""problem"" anymore and you're essentially reading a re-canonized Forever Dawn.

I’m saying she’s just over looking Jacobs flaws with consent here. Jacob is deeply wrong for that and for later in telling edward “she doesn’t know what she wants” this is wrong. VERY wrong. 

And i never said Edward didn’t deserve anything bad, i just meant he doesn’t deserve to get emotionally and physically cheated on. He would never do anything like that to bella or even entertain the idea that he would ever be in her shoes. And yes actually i’d say Jacob is a lot worse then edward in all ways. Jacob never seems to grow and understand what consent is and learns how to control his opinions or feelings. 

In breaking dawn p1 he leaves bruises on her arms after finding out Bella is going to have a “honey moon like anyone else” with edward. He literally grabs her again and she tells him he’s hurting her but he still doesn’t let go until his friends and edward steps in. 

Say what you want about edward, i never said he didn’t have issues or flaws that he had to learn from but he was never physically abusive to bella and at least he felt bad/actually made a effort to not touch her if he ever did get out of hand. Which is also sorta the whole point of him leaving in New Moon. he wasn’t expecting bella to fall asleep on the floor and not go back, he was leaving BECAUSE he thought he was putting her life in danger. and when he got back from italy he apologized repeatedly and actually hated himself for leaving her.

A walking corpse-statue and his dazzled singer/prey, a deterministic werewolf-bond to a magic baby, that's all unnatural.

We get a glimpse of Bella's lost natural fate in Eclipse when she has a vision of her older self with an older Jacob and their children and families, leading a happy, normal life together. 

And a significant part of Bella badly craves that life, which is why she breaks down and almost changes her mind after seeing it, but Edward's supernatural love has ultimately, irrevocably eclipsed her heart.

We could get real philosophical about whether or not these things were _supposed_ to happen that way. 

They were certainly _determined_ to happen that way, but that pretty much assures that there were alternative paths which were overwritten and lost in the process of said determination.

That very loss is what Bella and Jacob experience in Eclipse and it's the central, eponymous conflict of the installment, and their relationship as a whole. 

And not just theirs. 

Was Sam _supposed_ to break Leah's heart? Or was he _determined_ to? Was it right? Was it good? 

Again, some pretty complex philosophy there. Which is why I deeply appreciate Eclipse. It's a rather profound work that doesn't shy away from uncomfortable confrontations with the tragic clash of determination and choice. 

Meanwhile Forever/Breaking Dawn just takes the determination at face value and treats it as a good thing.

17lwa4b,I hate the way Stephanie treats Edward in eclipse.,k7ii8co,2023-11-02 14:51:26,"Yep, agreed. I remember what they’re talking about as there’s some imagery in Eclipse about Jacob and Bella, but it always struck me as Stephanie getting high on her own supply in a way. If we want to go all “natural fate”, then Bella’s natural fate was a morgue after Typer lost control of his van and crushed her to death. Full stop. That wasn’t caused by or involved anything supernatural until Edward saved her life. And if she didn’t die there, she’s murdered in Port Angeles by mundane humans on her trip with Jessica and Angela. 

And if we even take this a step further, Jacob only ever has a shot with her, because of the hole, metaphorically, that Edward leaves when he hurts her. Before that, he’s just a younger boy that visits from time to time with Billy with a crush. She doesn’t spare him many thoughts at all in Twilight until she needs his help to figure out Edward. 

Her “natural fate” if you take out being killed twice over was to finish school, move out of Forks that she hates, and go to college out of state, likely rarely if ever returning unless it’s to visit her father briefly. Jacob in life on the other hand doesn’t leave the reservation area, because his family and life is there. They’re not natural soulmates or something. He’s a guy who’s end up an acquaintance she barely remembers most likely, but Stephanie liked him so she came up with stuff after the fact.",Tacitus111

Cynical? Idk? of marketing strategies and how much of both marketing and business as a whole is flying by the seat of your pants and trying hard to deliver while shuffling statements and sentiments under a rug that don’t align with the shifting nature of the business/product being created/marketed.

To me, i could see where it would be DEEPLY uncomfortable for Stephanie to walk the fine-line of handwaving away Jacob’s actions because as a base character he was created to only really be a helpful expo dump with the radiant personality of her brother and the obvious familial care and support one would assume is there, and also, trying to make him suddenly appealing to Bella and a “viable option” for her, as the original endgame was Bella-Edward marriage and Baby and happy sparkly vampire life maybe with some volturi “wtf is this child thing?”

BUT I think that there’s a lot of valid criticism of Stephanie’s continued silence because ultimately, she was either subdued into her publishers demands or she agreed to them, and therefore the finished product reflects weirdly when held up and compared to comments she’d made beforehand about her inspiration, thoughts, and life.

This is not just some normal teenage relationship, it's about whether or not a girl should die for a supernatural love or live for a natural one. 

And Edward feels absurdly guilty for sealing Bella's fate like that.

Bella was already fatally hooked on Edward's supernatural charm when he left.

Jacob helped her through the withdrawals the best he could, but even when Bella was starting to do much better, she still collapsed on the beach and hurled herself off a cliff to see Edward shortly after. 

I think if Bella _could have_ chosen Jacob post-Edward, she ultimately _would have_, even after Edward returned.

But she couldn't. The moment she met Edward her fate was sealed. Her heart had been eclipsed.

>""He's like a drug for you, Bella."" His voice was still gentle, not at all critical. ""I see that you can't live without him now. It's too late. but I would have been healthier for you. Not a drug; I would have been the air, the sun."" The corner of my mouth turned up in a wistful half-smile. ""I used to think of you that way, you know. Like the sun. My personal sun. You balanced out the clouds nicely for me."" He sighed. ""The clouds I can handle. But I can't fight with an eclipse.""

The only way that Bella and Jacob could've been together would've been if magic never existed and Edward never entered their lives. 

That's where Jacob's resentment stems from.

17lwa4b,I hate the way Stephanie treats Edward in eclipse.,k7p73cp,2023-11-03 20:26:42,"She actually _was_ interviewed directly about that:

>Jacob was born - as a device, really - to tell Bella what she needed to know. And, yet, as soon as I gave him life, and gave him a chance to open his mouth, I just found him so endearing. He took on this personality that was just so funny and easy. And you love the characters you don't have to work for. And Jacob was not an ounce of work. He just came to life and was exactly what I needed him to be, and I just enjoyed him as a person. [...] So when my agent said: ""I want some more of him,"" I thought: _You know, I would love to do that. But I don't want to mess with [the first Twilight book] too much_. I wanted to have my editor's input before I started making any major changes. And my editor felt the same way: ""You know, I like this. Are you going anywhere with this wolf story?"" 

>So when I started the sequel, I knew there were going to be werewolves in it. [...] I knew that the sequel I had already started on would be about finding out that they were werewolves. And it wasn't _New Moon_ - it was much closer to _Breaking Dawn_. Because the story had originally skipped beyond highschool fairly quickly. But my editor said: ""Well, I'd like to keep the story in high school, because we are marketing the first book this way. And I just feel like there's so much that must have happened that we miss if we just skip to Bella being a grown-up."" And I said: ""Well, you know, I could always make my characters talk more - that's not the problem. Let's go back and have this kind of stuff happen earlier."" So I had a chance to develop it. 

>By the time I got to _Breaking Dawn_ the characters were so fleshed out - and their allegiances were so strong to whatever they hated or loved - that it made the story just a whole lot richer when I came to it the second time, because there was so much more backstory to it. [...] Jacob's character also became an answer to the deficiencies in Edward - because Edward's not perfect. There were things about him that didn't make him the most perfect boyfriend in the whole world. I mean, some things about him make him an amazing boyfriend, but other things were lacking - and Jacob sort of was the alternative. Here you have Edward, someone who overthinks everything - whose every emotion is overwrought - and just tortures himself. And there's so much angst, because he has never come to terms with what he is. 

>Then there you have Jacob, someone who never gives anything a passing thought and just is happy-go-lucky: If something's wrong, well, okay - let's just get over it and move on. Here's someone who's able to take things in stride a little bit more, who doesn't overthink everything. Someone who's a little rash. He does seem foolish sometimes, just because he doesn't pause to think before he leaps, you know? 

>That was sort of the opposite of Edward's character in a lot of ways. It gave a balance to the story and a choice for Bella, because I think she needed that. There was an option for her to choose a different life, with someone that she could have loved - or someone who she _does_ love. I always felt like that was really necessary to the story. Because when I write, I try to make the characters react to things the way I think real people would. I think that, in reality, it's never one boy - there's never this moment when you know. There's a choice there, and sometimes it's hard. Romance and relationships are a tangle, and this messy thing - you never know what to expect, and people are so surprising. [...] And it's an interesting thing to me how I worry about my characters like they're real people. Like how after I wrote _Eclipse_ - even though I knew exactly what was going to happen in _Breaking Dawn_ - until I actually got to the part where Jacob sees Renesmee for the first time, and his life comes together for him, I worried about him all the time. 

\- Stephenie Meyer, in the opening interview of _The Twilight Saga: The Official Illustrated Guide_

TL;DR: 

She agreed with the proposed changes by her agent and publisher, found that the two additional books greatly fleshed out the saga and presented Bella with an important romantic alternative and sees imprinting as an even better thing because of it, since it ""saved"" a now heartbroken Jacob.",Slashycent

Actually as i’m writing this out, you might be right in me saying she would defend that. I don’t think she views as what Jacob did to Bella as a sexual offense (even tho it is) because later on she even writes how Charlie CONGRATULATED Jacob for making a move on his daughter that resulted in broken hand and manipulative confusing feelings. Charlie laughed and it was made into a “lighthearted” thing. Stephanie had take that action very lightly in fact…

Her not hating the kiss doesn't mean anything, as she didn't truly consent.


His manipulation is definitely a form of abuse that is coercion- she wasn't truly willing, if he didn't threaten to kill himself she wouldn't have kissed him, and prior to that, he kissed her without permission too- so it's reasonable Edward wouldn't be upset, you can't be upset at the victim really, and he's lived long enough to understand that.

Whether the second kiss could also be considered assault depends on who you ask, but any way you slice it, it was still under some pretty dodgy circumstances. Either way, it has nothing to do with if she ""liked it"" or not because Jacob still pressured her into it.

17lwa4b,I hate the way Stephanie treats Edward in eclipse.,k7kx66l,2023-11-02 23:47:17,"It depends on what your definition of emotional cheating is. If you're talking about something like exchanging love messages back and forth with someone behind your partner's back or sending each other nudes, then yeah, that's cheating. You made a choice and decided to do that.

But that's very different than having a crush on a friend or finding a random stranger at the grocery store hot, which seems to be more along the line of what that person was saying. Bella didn't cheat just because she kissed Jacob, but because she got *enjoyment* out of it. And I don't think it's fair to condemn people for something they fundamentally have no control over, like their thoughts and feelings. (Not to mention people in real life often use the ""it doesn't count if they enjoyed it"" reasoning to excuse sexual assault.)

It has a lot of similar vibes to hardcore Christians who think having the desire to sin is just as bad as sinning itself. Black and white thinking does way more to harm people than to help, especially for those with anxiety or OCD who already worry about having ""impure thoughts.""",SatelliteHeart96

17lwa4b,I hate the way Stephanie treats Edward in eclipse.,ka1o2g2,2023-11-20 18:17:05,"Yes, we will have to agree to disagree here, because you absolutely *can* control your emotions (to an extent) as well as your *reactions* to said emotions. I know it's not a very romantic idea, but you do, to some extent, choose who you have feelings for because to develop feelings you have to spend more time with them, whether it's physical interaction or verbal/online communication. The less you communicate, the less attached you'll feel, point blank.   


Emotional cheating happens when said emotional cheater begins feeling things they should be feeling about their partner and, rather than leaning towards their partner and away from someone who is not their partner, they continue allowing those feelings to grow. This type of cheating directly hits your point of needing to do something for it to be considered cheating, as they are actively choosing to continue pursuing an intimate relationship with someone who is *not* their partner rather than recognizing that they are crossing a line that they should not. Bella? She leaped over the line, over and over again. She supposedly chose Edward and then she kept using Jacob for the intimate connection that she should have had with the partner she chose.

&#x200B;

TL;DR --- Emotional cheaters choose to emotionally cheat, and I guarantee that if it happened to you, you wouldn't much care that your partner hadn't kissed them or had sex with them, you'd still be hurt. As someone who has been cheated on both emotionally and physically, I gotta say that emotional cheating hurts much worse.",vega-starr

Edward DID CARE 

""Tracking wasn't a distraction then?"" I asked, curious, and also needing to distract myself. I was very
much in danger of hoping. I wouldn't be able to stop myself for long. My heart throbbed, singing in my
chest.
""No."" He sighed. ""That was never a distraction. It was an obligation.""
""What does that mean?""
""It means that, even though I never expected any danger from Victoria, I wasn't going to let her get away
with… Well, like I said, I was horrible at it. I traced her as far as Texas, but then I followed a false lead
down to Brazil—and really she came here."" He groaned. ""I wasn't even on the right continent! And all the
while, worse than my worst fears—""
""You were hunting Victoria?"" I half-shrieked as soon as I could find my voice, shooting through two
octaves.
Charlie's distant snores stuttered, and then picked up a regular rhythm again.
""Not well,"" Edward answered.” 

And then SM confirmed in the QA of New Moon 

“If Edward had had any inkling of the fact that Victoria had returned for Bella, no matter how far away on the planet he was, he would have been back in Forks within twenty-four hours.” 

Also in Twilight about the thing of Edward hating the wolves. even in Eclipse he doesn’t like the idea of bella being around them because they can’t control there emotions and it could hurt bella if one “got to close” and transformed.

""I owe you an apology. No, of course I owe you much, much more than
that. But you have to know,""—the words began to flow so fast, the way I remembered he spoke
sometimes when he was agitated, that I really had to concentrate to catch them all—""that I had no idea. I
didn't realize the mess I was leaving behind. I thought it was safe for you here. So safe. I had no idea that
Victoria,""—his lips curled back when he said the name—""would come back. I'll admit, when I saw her
that one time, I was paying much more attention to James's thoughts. But I just didn't see that she had this
kind of response in her. That she even had such a tie to him. I think I realize why now—she was so sure
of him, the thought of him failing never occurred to her. It was her overconfidence that clouded her
feelings about him—that kept me from seeing the depth of them, the bond there.
""Not that there's any excuse for what I left you to face. When I heard what you told Alice—what she
saw herself—when I realized that you had to put your life in the hands of werewolves, immature, volatile,
the worst thing out there besides Victoria herself—he shuddered and the gush of words halted for a short
second. ""Please know that I had no idea of any of this. I feel sick, sick to my core, even now, when I can
see and feel you safe in my arms. I am the most miserable excuse for—""",aliezee

She never would've developed feelings for Jacob in the first place if Edward didn't leave.

I don't think Bella is completely innocent here, but her crime was *not* having feelings for Jacob. You can't control your feelings, full stop. 

You can say she should've ended their friendship once it became a problem or that she should've still said no when Jacob was threatening suicide if she didn't kiss him, to which I would agree. But even with the (second) kiss, if you consider anything less than enthusiastic consent to not count as real consent, then well.... it *was* technically an assault, just like the first one. Either way, it's complicated.

Bella’s so fundamentally insecure throughout all the books - like cropping out photos of her and Edward because she doesn’t think she belongs in a photo next to that much perfection.

Then he touches her face and she kisses his hand, then he pulls away to make a point about how strong he is. Then he starts kissing her and she kisses him back, then he pushes her away again.

He never asks her to stop before physically stopping her, and she never touches him after being asked to stop before he touches her first.

Edit: Actually come to think of it, he never does ask her to stop touching him, only forces her to stop physically. The only time he actually uses his words is when he tells her to stop trying to take her own clothes off, still after he's already grabbed her hands and pinned her down.

>I was wrong.

>His mouth was not gentle; there was a brand-new edge of conflict and desperation in the way his lips moved. I locked my arms around his neck, and, to my suddenly overheated skin, his body felt colder than ever. I trembled, but it was not from the chill.

I really hate the quiet message of ""well, I love you and you did say that you were sorry!"" that colors it.

14vy5ud,Eclipse should’ve been about Edward winning Bella Back,jrgj22s,2023-07-10 21:52:25,"Dude, I recently re-read Eclipse for the first time in a few years or so, and I hated it. I hate it so much. It's the worst book she's written. Hear me out, I'll tell you why.

The sheer, blatant gaslighting that goes on all throughout that book makes my blood boil. The way Charlie doesn't get mad at Jacob for kissing Bella, and has the audacity to say to Bella, ""Maybe you should pick on someone your own size."" And all Bella says is, ""Maybe."" LIKE, WHY DOESN'T BELLA GET ANGRY THAT HE'S NOT ANGRY? WHY DOESN'T SHE GET UPSET THAT HE DOESN'T DEFEND HER? not to mention that when Jacob says, ""I'd never hurt you Bella"" after punching him, and she holds up her hand, he says, ""Well that's not my fault"", and then he also INSISTS that Bella liked kissing him. ""you know you liked it"" EXCUSE ME????? Correct me if I'm wrong, but SM was a full grown adult when she wrote these books, no? I just cannot fathom why she would write the two main male characters in such a toxic way. The more I read Eclipse, the less I understood why Bella even loves Edward, and why in THE WORLD she could EVEN love Jacob, especially with the way he acted in the entire book. Manipulating her into kissing him, and her doing it anyway?? 


""How will you stop me?"" He taunted lightly, smiling to take the sting out of his tone.

""Jacob, I'm begging you. Stay with me."" I would have fallen to my knees, if I could have moved at all.

""For fifteen minutes while I miss a good brawl? So that you can run away from me as soon as you think I'm safe again? You've got to be kidding.""

""I won't run away. I've changed my mind. We'll work something out, Jacob. There's always a compromise. Don't go!""

""You're lying.""

""I'm not. You know what a terrible liar I am. Look in my eyes. I'll stay if you do.""

His face hardened. ""and I can be *your* best man at the wedding?""

It was a moment before I could speak, and still the only answer I could give him was, ""Please.""

""That's what I thought,"" he said, his face going calm again, but for the turbulent light in his eyes. 

""I love you, Bella,"" he murmured. 

""I love you, Jacob,"" I whispered brokenly. 

He smiled. ""I know that better than you do.""

He turned to walk away.

""Anything,"" I called after him in a strangled voice. ""Anything you want, Jacob. Just don't do this!""

He paused, turning slowly.

""I don't really think you mean that.""

""Stay,"" I begged.

He shook his head. ""No, I'm going."" He paused, as if deciding something. ""But, I could leave it to fate.""

""What do you mean?"" I choked out.

""I don't have to do anything deliberate--- I could just do my best for my pack and let what happens happen."" He shrugged. "" *If* you could convince me you really did want me to come back --- more than you wanted to do the selfless thing.""

""How?"" I asked.

""You could ask me,"" he suggested.

""Come back,"" I whispered. How could he doubt that I meant it?

He shook his head, smiling again. ""That's not what I'm talking about.""


And don't even get me started on how Edward manipulated her truck so she couldn't go see Jacob. And then at the end of the book when he was finally gonna give her what she wanted, and she said no, he was like, ""Tell me why not, Bella. This had better not be about me."" Like excuse me, sir??? You're gonna talk to me like that?? I don't get how Bella was telling Jacob that she doesn't love Edward cuz he's rich and beautiful, but that he's ""the most loving and unselfish and brilliant and *decent* person"" she's ever met. Decent?? Unselfish? He's been selfish for the whole series! Loving?? I...


And Alice, oh man, Alice. She's almost worse than Edward, cuz she manipulates Bella, too. She offers no sympathy when she has to ""kidnap"" Bella on Edwards account, and when she called Jacob to tell him she wouldn't be able to go to La Push, I mean...heck, I'd be questioning her relationship with Edward, too, if she told me that she couldn't go cuz she was being held hostage against her will. ""Not allowed""?? Just huge, huge red flags all throughout the book. I know you're probably asking why I read the book anyway, if I hate it so much. I wanted to remember the details, cuz I hadn't read the books in a while, and I vaguely remembered Edward finally telling Bella she could have her way in the end, but even that wasn't as sufficient as I thought. Edward is just... rude. The entire time, I was wondering why Bella was even in a relationship with him. Like, bro, even Rosalie didn't do anything wrong here. I really wish SM had written Jacob and Edward differently. I know Edward is mentally 17 forever, but like...I'm requesting a personality change, because they're both just horrible, and Bella was extremely passive about all of it. I wouldn't go near em with a ten foot pole with their attitudes. 


All that to say, yes, I think that Eclipse should've been about Edward winning her back as well. Edward didn't even fight for her when Jacob kissed her imo. He simply threatened him. Heck, I think the movie handled that scene better than the book did, and I'm always dragging the movies for not living up to the books. Imo, Edward should've broken his jaw and whatnot. Like, he forcibly kissed your lady!! And then told her she liked it when she didn't!! Hello?!!!!!",Euphoric_Bet

Eclipse being the book where he is convincing her to marry him is boring.

14vy5ud,Eclipse should’ve been about Edward winning Bella Back,jrgwzt4,2023-07-10 23:33:05,"I agree about Edward begging for forgiveness but I do *not* agree with Bella “falling in love with Jake”. 

First, Bella already gets hate enough on this sub for choosing Edward, and for not standing up for herself more, and for the whole Jake thing. Making Jake and Bella a couple, and then having Bella completely shatter Jake’s heart even worse than canon would be horrific. The Bella hate if that had happened would be *unbearable*. Also, in Eclipse, Jake **forces himself on Bella**. Bella *BREAKS her hand punching him in the face*. Jake **MANIPULATES** Bella into kissing him so he didn’t go fight and then *he went anyway*! Jake was just as toxic, if not more, than Edward. Yes, Edward was a fucking ass who made decisions for Bella against her wishes or knowledge, but at least he didn’t force himself on her. I know some people stand by “SM ruined Jake’s character” it was “character assassin by the author” and while I do kind of buy this it doesn’t change the fact that, when it comes to canon material, Jake wasn’t no price charming either. 

Second, the Cullen’s *did not know* being in Forks made the werewolves change. Bella shouldn’t hate them for that. And I’m under the impression from reading the books, granted it’s been awhile, but *most* of the boys liked being werewolves, regardless. Not all of them, obviously, and Leah sucked big time, but most of them did seem to enjoy it, especially the ones who found their soulmates who might not have otherwise. But again, regardless of whether they liked being a werewolf or not, the Cullen’s truly didn’t KNOW that they made the wolves change until later on and by then, what, the Volturi was after them, and Jake was ride or die with Renesmee? Now that the Cullen’s *do* know they make the wolves change it would definitely be irresponsible, and maybe cruel, to stay in Forks or go back to Forks, but again, originally, they just didn’t know.

Again, I think Eclipse could have been better on SO any fronts and Edward deserved some shit from Bella for what he did BUT I don’t think Bella should’ve dated Jacob. That would’ve been a way bigger disaster at the end of the day.",Murderous_Intention7

Because he thought he did the right thing to protect her, which would it make difficult not to forgive that fast either. The reason why I think Bella shouldn’t have forgiven him that fast is, that even though he promised never to leave her again, I’d always fear he would again, when a dangerous situation occurs. Making myself so vulnerable, always fearing to be left, the constant fear… a strong protagonist (or a mature teenager as Bella is always described)would‘ve considered if she wants to be that emotionally dependent on him again and wouldn’t have believed him instantly.

I get your point about her being too easy on Edward though, but one also has to remember that Bella is canonically in an unreasonable state. 

She's intoxicated with Edward's charm and addicted to it as if it were a literal drug.

Also, I hate when Alice shows up in New Moon after Bella almost drowns and says something like ""Did you think of what this would do to my brother?"" The audacity!",Starlightblue01

14vy5ud,Eclipse should’ve been about Edward winning Bella Back,jss4hk5,2023-07-20 20:56:48,"I love this idea, mostly. Idk if I'd want Edward to be trying to ""win ber back."" The age difference and power imbalance between them is already weird enough. Putting him in a position of pursuit while she resists feels too uncomfortable. Bella could be too angry or distrusting of him to take him back, but maybe they decide to stay friends because they can't not be in each other's lives. Also, Victoria's around and Edward feels like he has to help protect her, especially since it's kinda his fault. Then, while they're angsting over all of this, Bella and Jakob decide to give it a try. 

Now, we get the chance to see why Jakob/Bella don't work together. And the eventual break-up should absolutely be a mutual decision. 

Maybe they start dating and Jakob realizes that he imagined things differently and the relationship isn't living up to his teen-crush expectations. Maybe he wants someone more laid-back, social, and silly.

Meanwhile, Bella sees that Jakob is a good force in her life, but just can't make a romantic connection fully happen. She also realizes that the core differences in their personalities make it hard to build a relationship. He's too high energy and unserious for her, maybe even irresponsible. For a sullen introvert like Bella, these are probably fun traits to have in a friend but very annoying in a bf. 

This storyline would give Jakob's character room to develop on his own. Early in the books, he is waaaay more of a bright spot and not so mopey and annoying. In this version, he's allowed to stay his happy-go-lucky self and it even becomes part of the conflict preventing their relationship. I love the idea of Jakob deciding he doesn't want to be with Bella because he likes who he is. 

Finally, when they break-up, Bella realizes that Edward is totally right for her and she starts trying to forgive him. It helps that he spends most of an entire book waiting for her to figure shit out, thus reassuring her of his commitment and helping her heal. 

Remember that line Bella says to Edward, ""This wasn't about you vs Jakob. It was about who I should be and who I really am."" A failed Bella/Jakob relationship would SHOW us that, instead of telling us.

And for book 4, Jakob is just back to being just a friend. There could be some tension and even awkward jokes about the two briefly dating, but that honestly sounds kinda funny.

Also, this makes the imprinting thing slightly (SLIGHTLY) less creepy.

I think she did protest in her own way, drove him mad with her stubbornness in Eclipse. Being stubborn to be wanting to be a vampire, being stubborn to keep the werewolf in her life, being stubborn about her college applications, being stubborn about not saying yes to the marriage.

I really loved the dynamic in this one. In twilight, Edward held so much power over Bella, and in new moon, i think it went better that Bella did not let Edward beg. Edward would have begged, but her, not believing that he loved her was a better way to handle the situation. He had to prove himself that he would not leave her.

I would have loved to see Edward grovel though.",RB_59

I feel like they made Jacob look like more of a villain by kissing her?? But Bella was the one leading him on!! They would have been SO good together!! 

After Edward left, I feel like they should have given Bella a revenge era. I suppose they kinda did by making her fix up the motorcycles but even then, she had dramatic nightmares and then Jacob ghosted her so that didn't rlly pass the vibe check.

Imagine Bella had an upset phase abt Edward but then she got over it, started dating Jacob and was in her rightful revenge era. Edward would be trying to win her back from Jacob's arms and then get her back!! Sounds like a good plot to me!!

In the movie, the SECOND Edward comes back she instantly forgave him?!!! He left her and didnt give much of a second thought to it! And then Bella practically kicked Jacob away like trash!! Edward had to literally think that Bella was dead to do something!

Not to be rude but I genuinely HATED the last few films, all the way through gave me the ick. Jacob imprinted of renessme?? Bella turned into a vamp instead of having a long, meaningful life with Jacob?? Idk it wasn't for me. So having Bella date Jacob- like I'm pretty sure we ALL want, would have been so good and definitely would have sold me. (Jacob also should have imprinted on Bella!!

14vy5ud,Eclipse should’ve been about Edward winning Bella Back,jrg0k50,2023-07-10 19:51:48,"My point was that she canonically did fall in love with him during New Moon and acted accordingly during Eclipse but only admitted it towards the end. 

But don't get me wrong, as a big fan of Jake and Bells I would've _loved_ it if they had gotten more of a wholesome and consensual romance.

I just think the issue is that that's not possible in the canon of the books. 

Just as she's ready to give in to her love for Jacob in the Paris chapter of New Moon, her addiction to Edward kicks in again and keeps her from committing to it. 

Then, after she saved the latter, she was helplessly under his spell again. Her heart has been fully eclipsed by his supernatural charm. It's the underlying tragedy of Eclipse, if not the entire series. 

It's tragic, unfair, heartbreaking and kinda grim but also profound in a way. 

Jacob and Bella have lost their natural fate to magical determinism. They never had a choice, no matter how much they wish they had. 

It's just a supremely tragic tale to me. Probably why, no matter how much I enjoy it, it kind of makes me miserable. 

But I can bask in that bittersweetness. 

I don't think Meyer quite intended that when she wrote Twilight and Forever Dawn. It was just simple wish-fulfilment escapism for her. 

Then she scrapped the sequel and replaced it with two much more profound installments that painfully deconstructed her entire fairy tale romance she dreamt up and when she noticed that there was no easy way back she panicked and ignorantly clung to the old ""happily ever after"" which had been completely re-evaluated and grown outdated by that point.

It is also mentioned how Bella felt unwanted and guilty for tieing her mom down and how making herself useful was how she felt she had to earn her place. That's a pretty text book system of CPTSD. Another side effect of that benevolence and lack of boundaries is that attraction of more selfish people and tolerance for bad behavior wich is part of why Edward is drawn in and takes advantage of that. Think about how selfish her mom is too springing a move nefore Bella is recovered. Also Rene prioritizes herself by prioritizing Phil and we know it was encouraged but also leaving before Bella is better. Rene is so self-centered that she never really connects and catches up with Bella despite their time apart. Charlie is not as toxic and tries to actually parent but he isn't as venerable as he needs to be to connect and was absent for some time in Bella's life.",

Your personality can gradually change over time so you exhibit less symptoms. People very rarely change their entire personality, though. I personally don't believe you even can. (Hence why who you replied to said they're not 'totally uncrazy' - it never fully goes away but with years you can learn to manage it and live normally) 

With proper treatment we can have pretty asymptomatic years. So in that way it's a lot like ADHD, we learn to deal with our symptoms. But pretty much all of us will fall 'out of remission' at some point. I don't remember the statistics, but they do exist somewhere.

1d9l9fn,Anyone else mad about Jacob with Bella in Eclipse??,l7h0lmn,2024-06-07 02:42:16,"I’ve been saying this for 13 years now. I didn’t pick the books up until I was 12/7th grade. I have never been team Jacob, but eclipse really did me in. I was disgusted. 4 years later I’d had several guys threaten to unalive themselves if I walked away from a relationship and I’d be SA’d. I reread the series literally months after my assault and got angrier and angrier at Jacob. I was mad at 12, livid at 16, now at almost 25 I’m just upset that Jacob couldn’t just be her friend. New moon epilogue was the start of his downfall where he shows Charlie the motorcycles and get Bella in even more trouble instead of calling and asking why she hadn’t come to see him. 

I could write a dissertation on how Jacob is an unassuming nice guy that is arguably more dangerous to Bella as a male to female interaction than Edward is as a supernatural being that craves her blood. It’s literally the man vs bear/vampire argument.  Jacob is not a safe person at all. And then all that… just to imprint on Bella’s literal child, rotisserie.",
1d9l9fn,Anyone else mad about Jacob with Bella in Eclipse??,l7fhwhl,2024-06-06 20:47:27,"Eclipse was always an anomaly with me, I was there for the craze, because I grew up with women obsessed with the series. However, now that *I’m* obsessed with the series, the Team Jacob and Team Edward argument does NOT hold up that well post Eclipse hype (especially the movie hype). Because Edward himself did pull the “I’ll kms” card as well, and he isn’t above making horrible decisions on part of Bella thinking he knows best for her. 

I’ll always be a pre wolf Jake defender. He and Bella formed a genuine bond/love and I believe if Edward would’ve never tried to commit, they would’ve ended up a couple and might I dare say— a *better* couple. A healthier couple. While there are shines of soft Jake and Bella sprinkled even after his transformation, and while I can understand Jake’s POV with all of this, and how him being a wolf multiplied his emotions tenfold… *(a symbolic representation of puberty and how trying to navigate something as complicated as love while your body and everything you know about yourself is constantly questioned and changing… and you find yourself reeling half the time, can sometimes hurt those around you…)* the stunts he pulls in Eclipse *isn’t* it, and not even Taylor Lautner’s good looks could save it.

I hated how Charlie brushed it off. LOATHED this part. Because I couldn’t imagine how *livid* I’d be to find out my sister had someone force themselves onto her. 

I hate how nobody truly checks him on it, and he continues this controlling behavior until BD. Hell, it gets a bit *worse* in BD. I don’t even want to OPEN that can of worms. At least Edward stopped his obsessive behavior in Eclipse.",SadBoyYori

That’s a fairly new idea. He definitely acts like a jealous child a lot of the time. And kissing her against her will is not okay. 

Jacob thinks Bella loves him too. He believes Edward is “controlling” her. He doesn’t want to see her throw her human life away for Edward. He kissed her because in his mind, Bella really does want to be with him but she’s scared. So he’s thinking she’ll finally realize he’s the right choice by kissing her. Doesn’t make it okay, but it doesn’t make me hate Jacob either. I’m still definitely team Edward. Edward also said he’d kill himself without Bella. Edward did a lot of questionable things actually. Like watching her sleep and making her truck not start and lying to her. But nobody hates Edward. I love Edward.

1d9l9fn,Anyone else mad about Jacob with Bella in Eclipse??,l7fk6j6,2024-06-06 21:00:18,"I think Jacob is important to show that Bella isn't a desperately lonely girl clinging to the first respectful admiration she ever got. But as a friend he's jealous, and as a wolf he's unable to see Edward rationally. 

What manipulative BS he gets up to in the book is Bella's to deal with, and she does think he's being a jerk and punches him but she gives him a little credit to be a friend again, which is by her choice.

If you take him out you lose a lot of Bella's character conflict reaction and resolution choices too, and they tell us a lot about Bella and her growth as a person. 

I think he's fine but driven across a line by the wolfy imperatives, especially as Bella acknowledges to herself that she needs him too, and pulls him closer when if she were healthier she would have been less close, less intimate.",ennuiFighter

I’d even say I was team Edward if they mentioned first that they were team Jacob 🤣 I was a nuisance. I’d never even read past the first book (we had to read it for a class book report). Years later in high school, I finally sat down and read them and all I could think was “why on earth would I ever be team Jacob??” Twilight Jacob was fine. A little crush on Bella but I liked him. Reminds me a little of Seth without the crush. New Moon is actually when I started to dislike him. At the time in high school I was going through the same thing in regard to dealing with a friend who had a crush on me. I’d imply we were just friends and they said they were okay with it, but like Jacob, you could tell that just underneath the surface, they were waiting for it to be more. And it sucks because I hate losing friends, especially over dumb shit like feelings. So NM Jacob was a no for me. Eclipse Jacob had me ready to swing. But then again so did Bella a little. I actually preferred that Jacob wasn’t hanging around. I get that Bella really wanted to be with her friend before she turned, but all I could think was “let him go! You know he wants to be with you and hates the Cullens, so why are you still being selfish by getting your fill of him before you turn? Just end it here.” She annoyed tf outta me. Her continuous attempts to stay friends with him and be around him made him think he actually had a chance and it irked me.

1fv5m93,"breaking dawn doesn’t hit the way twilight, new moon and eclipse did",lq6tyya,2024-10-03 19:53:08,"Agreed and I think Stephanie used the random POV switch as a sort of writing cop-out.

And the fact that Bella never wanted a family and suddenly was ready to die for it in her first conversation with Jacob, was already incredibly unbelievable. Imagine if we had to sit in her weird POV as she tries to do the mental gymnastics to make it make sense to her previous personality. 

Obviously SMeyer is religious and anti-abortion and her personal beliefs leak into Bella & Edward a lot in this case, but I’m actually glad she removed those characters from this portion so she didn’t end up preaching at us.

1fv5m93,"breaking dawn doesn’t hit the way twilight, new moon and eclipse did",lq8g9hh,2024-10-04 01:34:04,"I feel you in. Breaking Dawn is certainly a shift from the first three books!

This is only my first read-through of the series--but Breaking Dawn is actually my favorite book. Maybe it's because I'm approaching the series as an older reader (38F), but I was feeling a little claustrophobic in Bella's head by the end of book 3. It was just Edward Jacob Edward Jacob iwannabeavampire Edward Jacob. I accept that this series is written for teens and dramatizes the all-or-nothing, obsessive quality of teen love... but I was losing interest in Bell as a POV character because of her narrow narration. 

Enter Breaking Dawn. All of a sudden, shit is happening! There's a wedding. We're going to Rio. Bella's thirsty thirst is finally sated. Fuck, she's pregnant! 

Suddenly, we're in Jacob's POV. I felt a genuine sense of relief to be there. I'm not sure I can give Meyers total credit for this narrative choice because I don't believe she *intended* for Bella's head to feel so claustrophobic--but since Jacob literally shares his mind with multiple pack members, the narration actually felt free and open, the opposite. I enjoyed learning more about Leah, the wolves, and what was happening in Jacob's world. 

Not too long from then, wooooo we get the absolutely harrowing description of Revlon's birth--which I'm enamored of in that it's squeamishly effective writing. And then I'm so looking forward to Bella's transformation, because then *we as the reader get to become vampires via Bella's POV!* Which I found very satisfying in that both *I* and Bella get what we want, together. 

I wished the plot had reached this point *sooner.* Experiencing the world as a vampire is so much fun. I understand why the books are like this (Breaking Dawn was an epilogue, the publishers wanted more high school content/the love triangle, etc.) but I think I would've done it like this

Book 1: World is introduced, ends with Edward abandoning Bella

Book 2: Pretty much the same

Book 3: Somehow combine book 3 plot with the wedding/pregnancy; ends with Bella transforming 

Book 4: Meeting cool vampire friends and vampire battle",brownidegurl

By the time she talks to Carlisle she has already had multiple dreams about protecting a baby, felt the baby move, and come to the conclusion all on her own that it is actually possible/probable that she is pregnant. Some maternal switch has already flipped and her brain has already caught up to it. Protecting what she expects to be the beautiful child of her dreams is actually quite rational - at least in the world of irrational and supernatural elements she’s in. 

She doesn’t know what will happen and frankly neither do Edward OR Carlisle. She knows about enough about vampires to be dangerous, in that she doesn’t realize what birthing one could possibly be like. And then by the time it’s easily foreseeable as deadly dangerous, she has enough almost-blind faith in the combination of Edward and Carlisle to be able to save her (and the baby), and has had that much more time to bond with the idea of motherhood, particularly to Edward’s child. 

This is a stupid comparison but it came to me as I was writing: I was once invited to take (horseback) riding lessons from my mom’s friend. We went to the first one - though I’d ridden before, just not often - and mom must’ve made some crack about me being afraid or something, I don’t remember, but my response was that “I have good health insurance, I’ll be fine.” (Note: this was in the 90s, not recently by any means.) I had enough faith in medical care that the thought of injury didn’t worry me at all. Which was a stupid stance even then as a healthy 20-something. And hindsight is ironic, because I did actually fall off the horse that day, fortunately was not badly injured, but never went back because about as soon as I’d healed I found out I was pregnant and suddenly was not so cavalier about my safety. All that to say that blind faith and whatever that maternal switch is that goes on when you first get pregnant can make you do some things that you wouldn’t have believed of yourself.",abczoomom

Bella, after 6 months of absolute depression, begins to get back to being a person and then Edward comes back. 

She was even considering getting with Jacob before Alice comes back.

1i7ioad,eclipse book,m8ocyyy,2025-01-23 05:11:02,"I mean, I don’t think you’re exactly being fair to how Stephanie Meyer set up the story. You’re completely ignoring everything that happened in the prior book: New Moon.

Like Bella was completely abandoned and dumped by.l Edward. And Jacob filled a void inside of her. And developed a close emotional intimacy with her. One that can easily be plutonic between two friends, but that can just as easily turn romantic. And the only reason why you were romantic is because the other person happens to be the gender you’re attracted to and a quite attractive individual.

Let’s just put a sidenote of Bella‘s entire character profile here. In many ways, Bella‘s parents were not excellent parents. While they provided for her financially and physically, you got the sense. They were not emotionally there for her. They did not create an emotionally stable environment for her. In one way or the other, she was taking care of her parents. And that is a backdrop to have some really huge relationship issues either mommy or daddy issues in the actual real world. Having emotionally unavailable or neglectful parents, or even just immature, does not make for a great foundation for a child to grow up on. In that same not exactly great foundation makes room for these type of catastrophic bouts of depressive episodes were seeing and this really strong codependency on Edward from Bella. Her behavior in twilight screams the need for emotional attention and responsiveness to her and her needs. To her emotional needs not just her physical.

So back to the discussion of what happened in New Moon, we saw Jacob consistently trying to twist that friendship into a romantic situation. Which actually is quite common among boys of that age and grown men in my opinion. I know I’m not trying to hate on men, I just think it’s a pattern of behavior that I have seen many times. And obviously not all men and maybe not even the majority. But enough that this type of behavior has not gone on, noticed or commented on.

But as we fast forward into Eclipse, Edward is back again. But you can’t just erase one year of emotional connection and intimacy. And people who feel abandoned and otherwise emotionally traumatized, they have drawn to something that makes them feel better. And that was Jacob for Bella. And you simply cannot remove your emotions and turn them off. It’s not a simple thing. Oh well Edwards back so let’s forget Jacob. And I think that’s very realistic for what I’ve actually seen in real life in terms of friends around me having these tumultuous issues when they’re dating multiple people. In the sense that they’re still on the first or second non-exclusive date so they’re dating around to find the right person. You begin developing emotional attachments, two different people and then you have to choose.

First and foremost, I do not condone or support adultery or cheating. That being said, I think the closest analogy to real life that we can use is the military spouse. Cheating is a common enough thing among military spouses, it’s kind of maybe a trope in real life or something that is a real kind of thing discussed about deciding to get married to someone in the military the same way someone might discuss having children. It’s because their partners are away for a long time and they don’t have an emotional connection to someone else. And then they develop that emotional connection and it becomes inappropriate. Well, I don’t think anything can rationalize cheating, I can see how someone who is probably not emotionally mature enough to handle having a long distance relationship to someone in the military can easily rationalize their unacceptable behavior. Like you hear the rationalization of I’m so lonely and there’s no one to talk to and they’re never around. But this other person is around for me and they are emotionally available for me. So removing it from the concept of cheating, it makes sense but when you enter it into the concept of adultery and cheating, it makes no sense. But that is the dichotomy Stephanie Meyer set up in New Moon and Eclipse. But obviously Bella had been dumped at this point so there is no immorality on her part only Jacob’s in my opinion.

Another real life parallel we could match up to this is grieving widow is comforted by male friend that has always been in the wings, waiting for the husband to die. And in that case, this person uses a manipulates this individual’s grief. And then they gain access too much more intimate parts of that person’s life to integrate themselves in ways maybe wouldn’t have happened even before she was married to her current husband.

So I feel like to claim while Bella is just being I guess a bimbo or other senses derogatory terms for a female meaning loose isn’t really fair. You’re not acknowledging the emotional trauma and she went through. You’re not acknowledging the type of character Stephanie Meyer set up for a really bad situation. 

And I think another tangent to note does not love triangles are very popular. Like early 2000 it was love triangle galore. And the problem with the love triangle YA, is that they couldn’t promote polyamory to children. Like of course you wouldn’t be here for polyamory because you don’t approve of what you’re reading a new moon or eclipse. But the people who were OK with it and found it to be an attractive concept were also disappointed because eventually you had to choose one or the other. So no one I think arguably was happy with love triangles in the 2000s or this one. But not always for the reasons you don’t approve of it.

And I think, in some ways, looking back, I also knew that I wasn’t comfortable with how I felt like Jacob was forcing his affections on Bella. Because she was clearly friend zoning him, and he was trying to force the relationship to be more than what she wanted. And I think that’s what makes Bella choosing Edward all the more important. In someway, it acknowledges that Jacob was not actually behaving appropriately when Bella said I’m not interested, and then she broke his hand, punching his face in New Moon. 

So again, wow I think Bella did get herself into a awkward situation, she’s a complete victim in this situation and she shouldn’t be blamed for the sexual and romantic pressure that Jacob was pushing onto her, being a very traumatized and emotionally vulnerable individual at the time. I’m not gonna go as far as say as your victim blaming but I think you’re not doing the storyline justice or really analyzing the nuance I think it really needs to be analyzed.",BloodyWritingBunny

Stephenie Meyer does not feel like Jacob was some master manipulator who tricked Bella into feeling any love that didn't exist in her before.

""Jacob doesn’t have a tragic flaw. He has one goal and one hope. His goal is to save Bella’s life. His hope is that he’ll win her heart in the process. He fails at both. But that doesn’t mean he regrets trying. If he could do it over again, he’d do the same thing. Jacob couldn’t live with himself if he didn’t give saving Bella his best effort—he knows it’s going to hurt when he loses, but he knows it would hurt worse if he didn’t try. Does he do everything right? Heck, no! But he’s sixteen and he’s making it up as he goes along. Those who are upset by some of his tactics should consider his youth and the fact that he is, after all, right. Bella is in love with him. (In the end, it’s truly healthier for her to be aware of this as she goes forward with unalterable decisions.)""

I also always find it a bit tricky when people try to explain the series in such definitive terms but never once bring up any of the quintessential supernatural elements and dynamics at play.

Bella's not like a military spouse or a widow. 

She's like a girl whose heart has been eclipsed by a vampiric bond, and who's being torn apart between her love for her natural fated soulmate and her supernatural one.

The first part in particular makes Jacob much more of an underdog in his fight to save Bella's life, and also proves his insistence on her love for him right.

Bella was literally under the constant influence of drug-like, mind-altering vampire magic, making her want nothing more than to die and/or join them. 

If Jacob was just some random dudebro trying to get some, he would've had absolutely no chance to even remotely break through that (see Mike Newton). 

No normal highschool boy can manipulate himself through such an intense magical barrier.

It's only because there already was a fated natural love there that Jacob got through to Bella as far as he did. Like Meyer said, he was right.

I'm also not sure if I'd call it a Meyer-adjacent interpretation that Bella is 100% innocent in all of this. 

It's a bit reductive, since Bella's quite the complex character _because_ she has flaws.  

She had always shown some opportunistic, if not manipulative, tendencies of her own, starting with her flirting with Jacob to get info on Edward.

Her suffering in New Moon was obviously immense, but that doesn't entirely absolve her of the emotional strain she put Jacob under. Essentially using him to replace Edward while insisting that the relationship isn't as deep as that with Edward, but then also essentially signalling that she can't and won't live without Jacob. People like to talk a lot about Jacob's explicit death wish on the mountain in Eclipse, but most of New Moon is Bella implicitly doing almost the exact same thing.

And then, when Edward is back and her fate should be happily sealed, she keeps playing house with Jacob, entirely on her own terms, because she's clinging to that natural love of theirs and can't make her mind up, hurting herself, Jacob and Edward in the process.

Meyer even wrote a whole chapter of painful self-reflection about this for Bella at the end of Eclipse, and it's arguably the most character development and growth she ever receives in the series. 

I feel like that's what actually makes her storyline and character so interesting and nuanced, as opposed to total, agency-less, lily-white victimhood.",Slashycent

Depends on the definition of ""want.""

Technically speaking, she could help loving Edward even less, due to his vampiric charm eclipsing her heart, so even when she eventually wanted to love Jacob back fully, she wasn't physically able to, and it tore her apart.

I feel like that's why human-Bella had to die and be reborn as the different person that is vampire-Bella, with her human memories, characteristics and feelings burned away and all. 

That's what made her able to escape that torturous conflict within herself, even if it meant killing a significant part of herself.",Slashycent

And I've see love triangles in real life at that age. Friends who have a lot of guy friends and one wants more than they're interested in. But that friend isn't interested in return.

Its honestly a big issue with our my generation as socialized and raised because those situations are not just unique to the friends I had and have that continue to experience it.

I don't want to come off as preachy, and I'm sure you mean no harm, but, as an artist, it kind of pains me to see people letting a machine process their emotions and creative impulses for them, instead of just expressing them themselves. 😅

Those emotions you're feeling are such great fuel to try and write your very own version of the story!

And yeah, it might ""suck,"" initially, but it'll be authentically you, and you'll grow with it.

People like E. L. James have literally become world-famous authors with what started out as their own shitty Twilight fanfic lol. 

Just saying, don't undersell your own creativity and hand it all off to an algorithm. 

The ""worst"" possible amateur fanfic will always be more artistically valuable than the ""best"" AI-generated text.

Also, check out r/TwilightFanfic, if you want to find some refined, human-made alternative versions of the story. You'll find that people have written out all sorts of scenarios already, and maybe it'll even inspire you to write your own. 👍🏻",Slashycent

We listen we don't judge while eclipse is the worst movie I PERSONALLY LOVED SIDEBURNS EDWARDS I THOUGHT HE WAS THE HOTTEST IN THAT MOVIE but thats the regency enjoyer talking. 

 I know the general agreement is that he's the hottest in bd but I prefer Eclipse him 😃. Also the alice thing is actually real, in the movies we dont know too much but in the books it's obvious Alice enables Edward sometimes she's actually pretty ""toxic"" and dangerous,  (I still love Alice she my queen) but Smeyer's writing doesn't sound like Alice is being a good friend.

 I would argue Rosalie sounds the most same/ normal to the audience even though Edward describes her as vain. Also it's so evident that if Rosalie ever knew or was written properly she would have never let Edward stalk Bella or go into her home. That's why I really like fanfic rewrite where Bella and Rosalie are friends ,

 I still love Alice, but she's like ""female Edward "". It's weird to say but she treats (initially) Bella more like a pet/curiosity rather than a full fledged human being. (Its part due to smeyer writing, but from an universe perspective it reads differently)",hisoka_kt

Cause I'm sorry maybe it's my self preservation and wanting to look out for people o care about, but Bella was not worth all that trouble to be honest. Like why am I or the people I care about potentially getting hurt or killed for some teenage horny human who wants to throw away her life and become a vampire for a piece of icicle meat? Bella was not thinking shit through and needed someone to really sit her down and tell her the real shit. 

I also saw a post somewhere where they said something along the lines of ""Bella's chose was all an illusion cause she was doomed as soon as she got involved with Edward"". Which I agree with cause as soon as she really got involved they would of had to turn her eventually or potentially die trying to keep her human. I hate how Edward tried to hold off on turning her cause I feel like it was to late. After that whole James situation Bella should of been turned cause I could of done without all that shit that happened in the other books/movies. 

Carlisle isn't a good coven leader, he lets Edward and Alice run the coven cause they have the most useful powers. And while I do understand the importance of Edward and Alice, I also think that Carlisle still should of put his foot down with a lot of shit. And since Carlisle was with the volturi for 100 years then he should of known how they get down about the laws. Like if I'm a coven leader and I know how the volturi is then I'm not gonna potentially fuck up my safety and the safety of my coven for a human. Cause in canon the volturi is known to wipe out covens and even villages just to prove points and to collect vampires with powers.

I think it was incredibly unfair to judge them, given the circumstances.

Rosalie was desperate for a baby to mother for a long, long time. When Nessie showed up, Rosalie was ready to mother the shit out of her the second that critter was conceived.

Meanwhile Bella went through an incredibly traumatic pregnancy - she literally *died* during it, and then she came back in apex predator mode - and then Edward had to sit there and helplessly watch her go through it all. Both of them were in a bad place when Nessie showed up, and it made perfect sense that they weren't able to transition into parenting mode right away.

So it actually makes perfect sense for Rosalie to mother the new baby so everyone can adjust. If Rosalie wasn't there, Esme would have likely stepped up more, but Bella and Edward just weren't up for the task at that moment, especially considering this wasn't a regular baby. Rosalie was honestly the best choice in the entire family to be taking care of Nessie.

Once Bella was *past* the worst of it all, she and Edward became the parents they would have been if not for the trauma surrounding everything. They were a little awkward but well meaning, protective and actively tried to do right by her, and that's what was most important. That to me just makes them inexperienced, young parents, but not bad parents.",JustAsICanBeSoCruel

As a parent now, I honestly feel a bit bad for Bella because she misses those first few days after Renesmee’s birth where every one would have been figuring out their rolls and routines, and then there’s the added element of not being 100% certain that Bella won’t harm her with her newborn craze.

Maybe this is like that. Like the police don’t know its vampires per se, but they’ve seen attacks like it before (never on this scale), but they also don’t want to cause a panic by saying “something unknown is ripping the throats out of people and bleeding them dry,” so “serial killer” and “blunt force trauma” are the go-to lines to give the media.",Nuria_123

Or a car crash where you fly through the windowscreen would be classed as blunt force trauma. 

As would dying in a plane crash. 


Its just to differentiate from sharp object trauma. It doesn't mean no skin is broken. 

Your body can be a complete mangled mess from blunt trauma injury.

They could bite someone on the neck and then simply pulverise the head/neck with their bare hands. That would be blunt force trauma enough (eventually) to hide the bite marks",SnooSuggestions9830
