piratesofthecaribbean,11mhb1n,Why is “At Worlds End” so hated?,jbik7x8,2023-03-09 08:13:09,"People always say it's too complicated, but I never for a moment understood that. It just sounds like people can't be bothered to pay attention to the film and just want to switch their brains off and watch a dumb pirate film. Everyone has their own clear motivations and acts accordingly.

Jack: Initially just wants to survive so is ready to run. Is convinced to stand with the Bretheren to survive, then comes up with his plan to stab Jones' heart and achieve immortality.

Barbossa: Wants to fulfil his vow to Calypso. I'll admit I always missed the line about his vow the on my first watches so I was confused, but once I realized that it was the condition for his resurrection it made so much sense. So everything he does is in service to that goal. Until after Calypso is gone when he loses all hope and decides, fuck it lets go out swinging.

Will: Wants to free his Father. I'll admit I never understood why he needed the Pearl for that, he possibly wanted to take on the Dutchman in a sea battle but he didn't have much of a plan for that.

Elizabeth: Initially felt guilty about Jack. Now she want's revenge on Beckett

Beckett: Wants to eliminate piracy but is doing it in an oppressive way

Davy Jones: Wants to be freed from Beckett's control. Additionally he still has personal beef with Jack.

Calypso: Wants to be free

...

What I will say is there was a lot of unnecessary plot elements

The entire Brethren Court was completely irrelevant which is kind of nuts considering they are hyped up for the entire film and take up a significant chunk of the run time. 

None of them did anything in the final battle. Even their role in freeing Calypso felt pointless. Yes Calypso did help in the final battle by giving the Pearl a fair shot against the Dutchman, but let's be honest, the whole purpose of Calypso was to give an epic maelstrom so the final battle looked cooler. Which I'll admit was definitely worth it, I just think there should've been less emphasis on Calypso and the Brethren, or at the very least had the Brethren holding off the armada while the Pearl fought with the Dutchman.",HistoricalAd5394

piratesofthecaribbean,11mhb1n,Why is “At Worlds End” so hated?,jbjh438,2023-03-09 14:21:41,"There are too many scenes with characters debating and negotiating their terms. Not enough swashbuckling, high seas adventure. “I’ll give you X if you give me Y, which I will use to barter A from B.”

In OST, Jack needs to prove his allegiance to Blackbeard through an overly elaborate version of Russian roulette. It’s pretty dumb because guns back then only held one shot, so you have to listen to Blackbeard command a crew member to remove bullets from all but one and oh my god, why does it have to be so complicated?

That’s generally how things start to feel in AWE. A beautiful moment like the dead Kraken scene between Jack and Barbossa is nice, but there are just as many scenes where Jack and Barbossa are debating over how to say “are.”

I understand people thinking those scenes are funny, especially if you grew up watching these movies, but they don’t move the plot along, which leads to people feeling stuck in overly complicated nonsense. 

The first one was “get the medallion and put it in the box.” The second one is “I have a drawing of the key (which is somehow “much more better” than the key itself) which will lead to a box they need to stab. But Jack is conflicted so the plot gets more complicated. At World’s End doesn’t even have that. 

And finally, the entire plot of AWE hinges on uniting the Bretheren Court before the war. Then the war comes down to two ships and none of the pirates we’ve spent the past 45 minutes arguing with even fights. It’s a tremendous waste. 

Anyway, those are a few reasons why people are frustrated with POTC3.",lridge

piratesofthecaribbean,11mhb1n,Why is “At Worlds End” so hated?,k5ayh4i,2023-10-17 19:55:20,"I just watched it for the first time in years. I had many fond memories, but now I really don't see why I swore to it so hard.

It has good moments for sure, and the final battle is amazing.
That scene where Jack and Barbossa has a heart-to-heart is one of the best scenes in the entire franchise. We know they're mortal enemies backstabbing each other at every turn, but even so, they share a lot of history and camaraderie in the end. Especially when faced with mutal certain doom
.
But it is ultimately way too bloated, and the humour really went into ""haha they're silly"" territory. 

I hate all the scenes with the Jack duplicates. It's not funny. It's dumb.
Maybe if it wasn't so desperately played for laughs, it could have worked, but I don't need to see Jack Sparrow lick a rock, lick his brain, and obsess over a peanut. Seriously, what's up with that peanut gag!?

Also, I really hate how all the ""trademark Pirate characters"" go for a buddy-buddy adventure throughout the first act. Why the fuck is Tia Dalma along for the ride?? It's so weird to see her awkwardly stubble around with all the comic relive characters like that.
Especially because most of the people tagging along have no logical reason to be there, other than being stables of the franchise.

And then there are endless callbacks. Why is the rum gone? Haha. Parley? Haha. Oooh, Will made a pretty sword once and so on.

At this point in the saga, I'm surprised anyone let's Jack finish a single sentence when EVERYONE knows he is it all times completely full of shit.

Davy Jones being reduced to a sad sack after his total dominance in the 2nd movie is such a slap in the face. I get the the reason why and the function it has, but it makes him much less cool in retrospect. And why is he standing in a bucket when they meet before the last battle? That's so incredibly goofy. There's even smaller buckets behind him, implying he was carefully tiptoeing to the larger bucket. What the hell.

I hate the monkey being a funny sidekick now, I hate Elizabeth pulling a giant canon out of her ass, I hate  Calypso turning into crabs and doing NOTHING in the end, I hate the characters constantly stating the obvious ""now there's boats coming"" ""we're back"" ""it's a sunrise"".

And I could go on...

It felt too long (can't remember if the run time is actually the longest). The pirate lords don't have any action at the end while the movie hypes this huge war-like battle (it doesn't bother anyone anymore since they know what to expect now, but it was really lame on opening night). The action scenes and sword fighting are worse here, the Kraken battles in 2 are amazing, as well as the sword fights in 1, the battles in 3 aren't as good except the Sparrow vs Davy on the mast which is like a minute. And the big one, the jokes weren't as funny. Most people found Ragetti and the other pirate annoying here, same as the getting married during the final battle. Again, these are loved by people watching the 500th time, but opening night they were thought as bad jokes that made people roll their eyes.

I thought the whole Calypso-Davy Jones story line was done great. Her making a giant maelstrom for the Pearl and the Dutchman to fight in? I think that was some pretty great writing myself. Also, the entire Will Turner story line was fantastic. You see him making swords in CotBP, denying his pirate heritage and wanting nothing to do with any of it to him becoming essentially one of the best pirates of the Caribbean. 

On another note, something that came to my attention after a couple of years and plenty of rewatches, the story behind the sword that Will makes in CotBP is one of those things that I’m glad they did. Will made the sword for a British Navy officer and somehow that sword makes it through all of the films just to end up stabbing the man who made it. Just a small detail, but I think it’s neat they stuck it in the film like that and never really drew any kind of big attention to it.

The first movie was a fine standalone movie, it didn't need anymore. Then the second movie wasn't *bad* but it was eh and at the very least it pulled from lingering elements of the first movie like Jack's compass. The third movie *completely* jumps the shark. Suddenly there are not Pirate Lords and a Pirate Council, and the Goddess and the Pirate Code(what happened to it being more of a guideline?) and it just went off the rails. Even worse though was a lot of that shit didn't even need to be in the damn movie. Like the entire Calypso subplot served no purpose at all. A significant chunk of the movie was decided to this goddess shit when it added nothing, she was freed and then...*nothing happened* she just made a whirlpool at that was it. Also the whole pirate lords and council plotline served little to no purpose either. All this time and talk dedicated to their plan of...freeing Calypso which as I just mentioned didn't do much of anything at all. Then they fight but *no one else other than the Black Pearl even fights in the battle*. The entire plot severed no purpose. If you cut both the Goddess and Pirate Council shit out the movie would be far more streamlined and it wouldn't change much of anything plotwise.

It has everything a blockbuster should have: great score, dynamic action scenes and all the cast had such great fun and chemistry with it.

Cmoing oiff te brilliant Black Pearl was alwas agonna be a rog go bt to me,it dfeels like it´s treading water,it does so much running in place,at the end,no one as learned or grown or been in real danger. Feels like Verbinski is overwhelmed,ever attempt to top or just match the first ones wit and energy,its set pieces...it's all  competent and watchable and imo kinda meandering. 

Few nr.2´s in a trilogy as felt so much as filler and impossible to stand on its own feet like Dead mans chest. Except for the last ten minutes,you can skipo it and still get the gist.

And there is an obvious reason why DMC can´t boogie with At worlds end,a pivotal one; Mr.Geoffrey Rush. He is a legend and Barbossa,especially in AWE is him at his most unhinged,unrestrained,charming and charismatic.  People forget that these movies worked case of RUSH and Depp,not just Depp. 

&#x200B;

Did The Matrix sequels suck simply cause the Wachowskis misunderstood and abandoned their core concept? No. They crafted a complex,compelling villain,casted one of the top tier character actors of that era (Joey Pants),only to unceremoniuosly kill him off after he just executed half the crew. 

The machines got nothing on Cypher,you don´t waste a great baddie like that. Verbinski seems to realize that and bringing Barbossa back was a genius move. Does it seem a bit uninspired and frankly jarring to turn the antagonist of the first one into a sidekick/comic relief? Initially yes,the mind gets some reframing to do, but he´s such a great character,

But the whimsy,the freewheeling,bizarro imagination and its willingness to not quite make sense,to sacrifice complete coherence in the service of the zany,of glorious visual spectacle and most of all,captivating a finicky audience. 

The movies balls to stray from the safe commercial path and get weird is admirable,Davy Jones locker pretty much explains AWEs weed budget. So many creative choices here feel really bold,whacky and not things you would expect a big studio to enthusiastically greenlight. Verbinski gives  off some David Lynch meets Guillermo Del Toro vibes in this one. The concept of intrusive thoughts that give you good vibrations in cinematic form...pretty apt description of AWE.

piratesofthecaribbean,11mhb1n,Why is “At Worlds End” so hated?,k5sb3sj,2023-10-21 03:57:43,"To combat some of what you said, it is a Disney movie, I feel like that’s the same thing I say when I see people complaining about MCU comedy. Yea it tackles darker themes for the adults but in reality it’s meant to be a silly kids movie. The comedy relieves the tension because as nice as it would be to have a dead serious Pirates of the Caribbean movie that’s not what the franchise is built around and getting too dark and gritty would make it not kid friendly. 

Also, I think a decent justification for the callbacks is that originally this was meant to be the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, but then Disney was Disney and demanded that they leave it open for sequels in the very end. To bring it back around to the MCU again it’s kind of like complaining about all the callbacks in Endgame. At Worlds End is meant to be the end of a trilogy. Generally that’s why the following movies are so unliked, they feel unnecessary. Like the MCU.

There’s also some points where you brought up “problems” with the movie that in reality are just gags built on previous lore. Such as Davy Jones and the buckets. They tell us that the captain of the Flying Dutchman is only allowed to step foot on land every 10 years, and I doubt Davy Jones would want to waste it standing on a cay somewhere having a parlay. So the buckets are full of sea water so he doesn’t necessarily step on land.

Also… you seem to have a lot to say about things that are pretty clearly important being problems. Tia Dalma is with them because this nonsense to save Jack is her idea and because she cut a deal with Barbosa for her freedom. The “Buddy-Buddy” adventure is a continuation of the last scene from the previous movie where all the characters agree to rescue Jack. We also know that Davy Jones is a sad sack before we even meet him. According to Tia Dalma in the scene before we meet Jones, the reason his heart is even cut out is because of a woman. Also Tia Dalma does do something in the end. She creates a maelstrom that allows the Pearl and the Dutchman to have a one on one fight before all hell breaks loose between the two lines of ships.

The Jack duplicates are clearly shown to be Jack losing his mind because he was stuck in the locker. None of them are actually there and they show us that in the first scene we get with Jack where it cuts away from him for a second and we see that all the Jacks he was previously giving orders to aren’t actually on the Pearl and he’s just talking to no one. 

The peanut is up for interpretation. When Johnny Depp was asked about it, he quoted “When you have nothing, a peanut is everything”. I always personally thought that it was torture Jack more because sometimes so little of something that it doesn’t even matter is worse than nothing. Like dying of thirst in the middle of a desert and getting a single drop of water. 

Finally. Although generally Jack is full of shit people tend to let him finish because he is a lot smarter than most people give him credit for and Is typically one step ahead of most people at any given time. He’s a liar, and a cheat, and a manipulator, and an idiot. But he consistently has things figured out. 

Whether it’s using tomfuckery to commandeer a navy ship, swindling the Royal Navy into working towards his interests, stealing the last piece of Aztec gold to make himself immortal to be on even grounds with his foe and then using that same piece of gold to eventually finish him off. Or looking for the key to Davy Jones chest before Davy Jones even found him again, convincing a society of cannibals that he is their god, then talking his way out of his debt temporarily. Or figuring out that they needed to capsize the Pearl to return to the land of the living, talking his way out of his debt again and cutting fake deals to insure his safety, not raising the alarm although he knew Will was a traitor because he could use him, and making Elizabeth Pirate Queen with his one vote knowing they shared interests, then using the heart to bring Will back to life and finish off Davy Jones with a single stone. 

The point being, Jack is constantly full of shit, and nobody should honestly believe a word he says.  But Jack is always working on some overall plan to fulfill his own interests. So working with Jack isn’t necessarily a game of trust, but a game of hoping that you’re aligned with his best interest. Because if you are it usually bids well for you.

This is probably a lot, but if you actually chose to read through it. I hope that some of this has helped you gain a better appreciation for the movie.",HereForStolenMemes

Yes- Jack was dead. He ended up in Davy Jones’ locker (body and soul) from being eaten by the Kraken in Dead Men’s Chest. 

Calypso couldn’t bring Jack from Davy Jones’ locker because he was essentially in purgatory. His BODY and SOUL was trapped in Davy Jones’ locker. Davy Jones sent him there for not paying his debt. (99 souls in 3 days and/or servitude on the Dutchmen) 

Barbossa was only dead. Calypso had Barbossa’s body with her and therefore had the power to bring his soul back. 

The entire crew ended up in Davy Jones’s locker too by essentially killing themselves when they fell off the waterfall AT THE END OF THE WORLD.. that was the whole point of the mission.. they stole the map from Sao Feng as a guide to get back from Davy Jones’s locker. The map is what helped them get back to real world, that’s why they had to rock the ship and flip it at sunset. Because Davy Jones’s locker is the underworld.. or “hell”. 

And do you know why they had to save Jack in the first place? In order to free Calypso from her human bond, all 9 Pirate Lords must give up their “nine pieces of eight”. Jack is a Pirate Lord and the beads from his hair piece is one of the artifacts needed to set Calypso free. 

I recommend going back and actually pay attention to what’s being said specially by Calypso, Will, Davy Jones and Jack Sparrow. All of your just questions sounds like you didn’t pay attention to the plot at all.",Individual-Ability48

Jack was taken to Davy Jones's locker. Body and Soul together when he died. Calypso says this I the movie when someone else asks the exact same question. 

They went to the ends of the earth, the literally edge of the world, and fell off to enter the locker. This is fairly hard to grasp I know, but because they went both body and soul, they were able to pull it off and find Jack.

Maybe they can't kill him, but they could cut him into pieces to keep him from attacking. The Kraken on the other hand seemed absolutely unstoppable, so I didn't understand why they got rid of it.

I also don't understand what happened to Calypso. She swore revenge and then she did nothing??? I thought she'd simply kill everyone.

Boring is a valid interpretation but very subjective. The brethren court politics were admittedly tedious, but everything else, all the back stabbing, betrayals and plans were very enjoyable to me. But I can get why someone might think it boring.

Absurd is the one I can't see where you're coming from. If you argue it here, then it also applies to the first two movies where Jack has cartoonish scenes, swinging about like Spider-man, using a boat as a submarine, the navy being dumb enough to not leave anyone on the interceptor, the whole water wheel fight, and surviving a fall off a hundred foot cliff with no apparent injuries.

The only ridiculous thing that breaks my suspension of disbelief in this movie, is the armada turning away after its flagship is destroyed. Surely there would be some kind of second in command hierarchy in place. But that's something I can easily ignore because the third act battle is epic as fuck.

The maelstrom really just cements why the Pearl and the Dutchman are locked in one on one combat. No one is stupid enough to get involved or really can without causing more harm then good. 

Then when the Pearl emerges victorious the whole thing isn’t just over, the Endeavour pushes forward into battle and then immediately gets rocked by the Pearl and Dutchman side by side.

piratesofthecaribbean,11mhb1n,Why is “At Worlds End” so hated?,llp6uw2,2024-09-05 21:59:42,"Can I try and explain it, since it does involve a lot-

Even if the original person who aske dis gone, for those who come across this can read this to understand.

One, Beckett had Davy Jones kill the Kraken as he didn't want him to use it against himself or the company. It was a wild card that Jones used and I doubt Beckett trusted him with the beast since it could potentially be used to attack on Jones's command. Thus, he ordered him to kill it. Jones didn't have to use his ship, just lure the beast to shore where it could get stuck and possible suffocated.

His crew seem like they can be killed, but in reality it seems more likely they can regenerate for the most part. You would have to do something serious like cutting off a whole limb or head, and even then as seen in the second film that's not enough. 

The Kraken, whilst near unstoppable, was still a threat to Beckett as whilst he may have heart of Davy Jones, if Jones choose to he could just use the beast on the company. Thus he had Jones kill it.

Calypso did take revenge, she was responsible for the storm. Jones says her name whilst looking up at the clouds just before the battle begins in the maelstrom. He says her name, thunder roars, and then we see him roar back in fury and pain. She's a sea goddesses and cna control the weather and ocean.

The Armada fled because they just watched the flag ship get annihilated right in front of them. The pirates resisted hard and forced them back. Beckett didn't fire because he knew it was over. You see him as he realized the Dutchman is no longer under his command. He sees it approaching and that's when he realizes he lost. It didn't matter if he ordered to fire or not, since the Dutchman was a supernatural ship, it's doubtful Beckett's own would sink it anyway.

Beckett knew he had been out played and there was nothing he could do, so he froze. The ending makes since once you take your time to look through each scene and listen to what the dialogue is being said, then what you get shown. It's subtle like that. A movie like it isn't just going to tell you right to your face what's meant to be happening, it shows you and tells you enough to figure it out.",Impressive_Echidna63

piratesofthecaribbean,11mhb1n,Why is “At Worlds End” so hated?,jbk95ew,2023-03-09 17:25:00,"If the screenwriters had been given more time to develop the script, I think they could have streamlined the motivations and conflicts. They’ve written themselves into a corner with so much lore and history and rules that it ends up as a mountain of text. 

One of the better moments in the movie is when Jack has to choose between stabbing the heart himself or saving Will and granting him immortality. The movie doesn’t need a monologue to explain Jack’s dilemma because the dramatic work has been clear. 

You’re right that it would be awful to have a character explain everyone’s motivations straight to the camera, but having characters explain their motivations to one another isn’t much better, especially when their motivations are just laid out one right after the other as a list. 

The Pirates sequels are overflowing with great action set-pieces and colorful characters and more than enough thematic ideas but the script was written too quickly. 

In DMC, Jack gets a drawing of a key from a prison so that he can find out what the key looks like so he can find the key, so he can find the chest, so he can stab the heart and avoid going to Davy Jones Locker, even though he could have just found the chest and held a cannon to it like they do in AWE. 
At one point, Davy Jones gives Jack three days to find 99 souls but that plot is immediately discarded and Jack just uses the time to find the chest which he could’ve done right away anyway because he had the compass. I know Jack is conflicted so the compass doesn’t work but he could have given it to Gibbs. 

At World’s End is a crazy movie but burdened by more rules and cultures that don’t effect the plot. It’s a lot of entertaining fetch quests. 

In COTBP, Jack wants to Pearl, Will wants Elizabeth, Elizabeth wants Will, and the Pirates want their freedom, and they’re all going in the same direction and leading to the same place. 

In AWE, Jack wants to live forever. Elizabeth wants Will AND Jack? Will wants to liberate his father. His father wants Will off the Flying Dutchman. Beckett wants control of the Dutchman so he can rule the sea. Davy Jones wants… to be free of the East India Company (?) and to have Jack’s soul. Sao Feng wants to free Calypso cuz he’s like that. Barbossa wants to unite the Brethren Court to free Calypso so he can live again. Calypso wants to be freed so she can have her vengeance with a whirlpool that sinks zero ships. And Norrington wants nothing because his arc has been completed so he has to die. Same for Governor Swann. 

Do you see what I mean?

I love the maelstrom fight, the Sergio Leone sequence on the spit of land, the Up is Down scene, the multiple Jack’s and the crabs. It’s WILD. But it’s not even close to a streamlined narrative because they had too many ideas and not enough time. On the DVD, the writers joke openly about how they’re handing in first draft pages, right before they have to film those scenes. 

To answer OP’s original question, I don’t know about hate, but I was there in 07 and people were just straight up confused by the amount of stuff they were supposed to remember and care about. Some DVDs came with a question and answer sheet.

Her becoming King was a great concept, and personally I think she fits the role better than most other characters in the franchise, having the cunning and wit of Sparrow but also Will’s sense of honor and justice. It’s honestly a shame we never got to see her do much in the role. I wish the later movies expanded on this more. 

The wedding scene to me always read as kind of corny and pandering to fans. This series has always had comedic elements but having a wedding ceremony mid-battle in the most important fight of everyone’s lives is where I have to really suspend my disbelief. 

I actually agree with the Kraken thing. A lot of people get butthurt over it when they don’t realize that Beckett did that to keep Jones in line as opposed to the beast being ‘ too powerful ‘. 

The pirate lords imo were not a good expansion into the lore. They were shoehorned in abruptly with no set up and do fuck all save for Sao Feng. Remember, despite all parties present, the only ships that do anything are the Pearl, Dutchman, and Beckett’s vessel ( the name escapes me ). The others don’t even fight in the background. They just stand there. Kind of makes the final stand seem a bit smaller than it should.  

I have many more complaints, but even with all that said AWE is my second favorite installment in the franchise, and even with its lows its miles better than the stuff that came after.",Muted_Guidance9059

If it was made and released today it would probably be a 10 episode series with 1 hour+ episodes to fully flesh everything out and people would love it. Netflix wasn't a thing back then and people didn't find it so comfortable to sit in a theatre for 3+ hours with no intermissions. Great movie, perhaps the wrong time to come out. It has everything a blockbuster should have: great score, dynamic action scenes and all the cast had such great fun and chemistry with it. Also, I remember being impressed as a teenager at the time with how brave Disney were to end it on a bittersweet note with Will dying/not dying but forced to stay at sea for 10 years. I thought that was very impactful. I rewatched the entire trilogy recently and although I love all 3 I think Worlds end might just be the best.",optimumpressure

In the case of art, the objectively good things are well remembered long after their creation. However, there seems to be a concerted effort to remember objectively bad art recently (Ex. The movie: The Room) but I think it’s just a characteristic of the current young generation making fun of the older generations. But it’s neither here nor there.",Dr-Filth1965

As far as if it would have translated well into the film or not, well...I can't say. I wouldn't have minded it, being that it would have been a line said near the climactic end of a trilogy.

Elrond: ""You will be the fellowship of the ring"" 
Saruman: ""the union of the two towers""
Gandalf: ""what gives you authority to deny the return of the kind, steward"". 

Maybe they are a product of their time but I think they work. I think this example for POTC would have been cheesy even at the time, especially from Elizabeth and at the end of the movie.

piratesofthecaribbean,1gshgoq,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End,lxetpw0,2024-11-16 10:01:46,"I think At World's End has some truly epic moments and an amazing sense of adventure. The Brethren Court and the final showdown with Davy Jones are definitely highlights for me. On top of that, I think this movie has the best visuals in the entire series,the cinematography is stunning, and the attention to detail in the sets and costumes is incredible. That said, while I enjoy the movie, it’s probably my least favorite of the original trilogy. Some parts drag a bit before the epic finale, and I feel like the story tries to cram in too much, leaving some characters underdeveloped. For instance, Norrington deserved a bigger role after everything he went through in the previous films, and Elizabeth’s arc felt rushed, it could’ve used more time to really show her growth as a leader. On a personal note, I would’ve preferred a different ending for the main characters. Not that Will shouldn’t have become the captain of the Flying Dutchman, but I wish they’d stuck to the original idea where he’d be freed after ten years because Elizabeth stayed faithful. That would’ve felt like a more satisfying and hopeful conclusion to their story. Of course, this is just my personal opinion. I’m not a film critic, and I understand others may feel differently. For me, it’s an enjoyable movie with many interesting ideas that helped make it memorable, but not as impactful as the other two in the trilogy.",RelationAcceptable32

As a result, characters start the movie running for their lives. They keep scrambling.

This hits a head in PotC3 where they never completed a draft. 

They spend the entire movie getting Jack back, finding the Bretheren Court, and assembling an army for war, only for the final battle to be one-on-one, without a single new Pirate firing a shot or drawing a cutlass. 

It’s a massive waste of time and proof positive that all they knew was that they wanted Pirate Lords without any thought of why or what it would contribute to the narrative.  They trusted that the writers would sort it out. They didn’t.

-What sank it in the first place?
-Why the debt?

You won’t understand these unless you’ve read the novel “Price of Freedom” which explained it all.

Was it confusing at first? Of course, though in fairness I was a tad late into the POTC hype and couldn't dive in as much as other fans. But just from the final hour of piratical and titanical fun alone was...well, fun. The Maelstrom battle was a CGI extravaganza, but for me it was still a good extravaganza, rivaled only by a few of the MCU's Infinity Saga, but even then I still love it. Quite frankly, P3 was still a great ending to the series. Will and Elizabeth's ending was bittersweet, but I felt it was enough to know at the time where Will could have been freed 10 years later...but freaking P5 ignored this and decided to add 10+ more years to Will's duty, among other head-scratching story decisions, which to me is still not cool to this day. Some fans didn't like the idea of the Black Pearl being stolen again from Jack, understandably so, but I still felt the ending was complete enough. How the story continued in P4-5, well...I guess it depends on who you ask - I like P4 more than most, but P5 deserves every bit of criticism it got and still gets.

>It’s an epic adventure with fun plot twists and clever handling of the puzzles to both get in and out of the locker. 

One of two reasons why I love Sao Feng's Map, Map of the Land of the Dead, Mao Kun Map, whichever.

The puzzles being one. Two being just a well-designed prop. It may be my favorite map...period. 

>On top of that, I think it has some of the best comedy in the franchise.

Pintel and Ragetti...'nuff said. I did miss them, but I can also understand the reason they were omitted in P4. But given how every screenplay draft and the final version of P5 itself confirmed that Jack the Monkey (Cotton's Parrot in Terry Rossio's version) were trapped in the bottle, it may be that Pintel and Ragetti are somewhere out there...and no, I do not believe they are dead and until I see two bodies, you can't convince me otherwise.

1. The Black Pearl sunk -- the cause of it sinking isn't defined in the movie itself, but well...that's hardly the most unusual thing to happen to a pirate vessel.

2. Jack bargained away his soul to Davy Jones in return for raising the Pearl from the ocean depths -- not out of character for Jack, as we know in CotBP exactly the lengths he's willing to go to regain his ship.

3. Beckett had past dealings with Jack, they had a falling out that ended with Beckett branding Jack as a pirate, and now they're back in each other's lives, wheeling and dealing again. The vagueness of their relationship is no worse than, for example, Jack and Tia Dalma's.

piratesofthecaribbean,1gshgoq,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End,lxga4wa,2024-11-16 16:29:13,"Ok. I’ll take it beat for beat. 

The cast nearly shooting each other is a lousy scene. It’s not particularly funny and it goes on for ages while characters talk about their goals. 

The Death of the Kraken is emotional and I like the way it’s shot. I’ll give you that one. 

Jack’s deal with Beckett is conniving and enjoyable enough but I don’t believe that Jack is in love with Elizabeth, nor the other way around, so it is, like the gun scene, a lot of characters talking and negotiating. Jack’s escape is fun enough but ruined by Jack going back to the rum well for the eighth or ninth time in the movie. 

1st reveal of Calypso’s existence. Calypso is the definition of plot over character. she’s supposed to have this powerful relationship with Davy Jones but that’s only felt in one scene and her character is ultimately pointless since all she does is return to the sea and start a whirlpool. If we had kept her as a two scene character in DMC, she would’ve been more effective. Like everyone else, she’s stuck standing around explaining rules to the audience. 

Sao Feng is introduced for the purpose of making Elizabeth a pirate lord. She doesn’t learn anything about herself in the process. The joy of watching Will and Elizabeth become pirates in the first film is exciting because we knew Will hated Pirates and Elizabeth longed for adventure. In this movie, Elizabeth is handed around and given a promotion by error. It’s not clever writing. It’s just convenient. 

Bootstrap losing his mind is sad. It’s also clear that the writers had no idea what to do with him. Why can he teleport in his intro and never again? Why introduce him at all? Is Will struggling with his past and now has to confront it? Not really. Are Will and Elizabeth getting married and he wishes his father could be present? No. His dad is introduced in 2 because that seems the thing to do but then they’re stuck because this is a narrative issue which is not tied meaningfully with the character’s emotional journey because none is ever established. 

Will betrays the group, yes. But because we’ve already established that nobody in this movie trusts anyone, that doesn’t feel like anything. Who cares if Will double crosses Jack? He teams up with Becket in Singapore. The audience doesn’t feel the betrayal as much as they might have. 

Norrington’s role in 3 is supremely disappointing. Unlike every other character in 2, Norrington actually gets to change! He goes from being a commodore for the British royal navy to a drunk on the pirate island of Tortuga and desperate to reclaim his title.  All he gets to do in 3 is dress up as he did before, feel uncertain, and then liberate them. It’s sad that he died because the character didn’t deserve it, but I’m also not sure what the point of it was. He could have gone with them but the writers know that you can’t just bail Elizabeth out of jail without some form of consequence, so trots James Norrington, a character who doesn’t do much so they can kill him off without losing anything in plot. His arc in the first movie is beautiful. His arc in the third movie could generously be described as tragic. 

Now Mercer controls the Dutchman by holding a cannon to the chest, which only emphasizes what a waste of time most of the second film is. Jack breaks into a terrible prison to get a drawing of a key (which is apparently “much more better” than the key itself? Come on Elliot & Rossio, you gotta do better than that!) All they needed was to get the chest of Davy Jones and hold a fuck off gun in front of it. What was the purpose of fighting for the key?

The Bretheren court is the worst of the bunch because they serve zero purpose in the story. None of them contribute to the final setpiece at all. The Lords aren’t even on the Black Pearl when they free Calypso. They’re well designed and fun to look at. I love the Penniless Frenchman the most. But they’re all empty calories.

Imagine if freeing Calypso was a moment for Elizabeth to say the words of a lover. Will and Elizabeth are dealing with a crisis of trust which is never meaningfully explored in the movie because no one trusts anyone until it’s time for the big fight at the end. We could’ve had a moment where Will accuses her of being cold and unfeeling. Maybe even heartless. Like she never cared about him the way he thought. And then she could be the one to say that moments of intimacy are quiet and personal.

Calypso turns out to be a vengeful woman who tries to sink everyone. I’m not sure what the movie is trying to convey here but it’s ultimately unnecessary. The fight against the Dutchman would’ve happened regardless.

Ragetti is the most emotionally open of all the pirates. Certainly, he is the least bound to perceptions of heterosexuality and masculinity. But this is a major moment in the movie, since it is meant to propel us into Act 3. It would have hit harder as a statement for Elizabeth to make, imo.",lridge

Some people just have short attention spans, hell imo even when you didn't see a single marvel movie you could watch endgame or infinity war and still follow the movie (I had a few kids who obviously hadn't seen a single avengers movie since they didn't even know who Hawkeye or ironman was), but in AWE it is easy to miss stuff, and imo it makes less sense if you haven't seen DMC beforehand, but that's just my personal opinion.

I feel like a lot of people also only realised how spoiled we were with the first three movies when four and five came out, I mean...

Norrington outgrew the framework he structured his whole life around, and found there was no life left for him, like Javert throwing himself into the river Seine. His death makes sense to me as the ending for his character.

I've found that audience/fan feedback is overwhelmingly more positive nowadays in comparison to when it was released, and I believe that the post-GOT/MCU world is a contributing factor in its reevaluation.

Personally, though, I would’ve liked to see her take a more active role in the final battle. 


For Norrington, I understand why his death works for you, especially with the Javert comparison. But I think his character had a lot more flexibility than Javert’s rigid worldview. In Curse of the Black Pearl, for example, he shows selflessness by letting Elizabeth and Will follow their hearts, which is something I think Javert would never have done. His sacrifice in At World's End is definitely noble and fitting, but I wish he’d been given more attention in the third movie. Exploring his inner struggles more deeply could have added weight to his story. That said, I’m personally not a fan of the fact that he was killed by Bootstrap in a surprise attack, it felt a bit anticlimactic for a character like Norrington, who deserved a more meaningful confrontation. I also think he didn’t necessarily have to die for his arc to feel complete. Surviving could have opened the door for him to find a new sense of purpose, rediscover himself, and even work to make amends for the choices he regretted while serving the East India Trading Company. That would’ve been just as meaningful, in my opinion.

I disagree that Norrington's death is weak. It wouldn't hit the same for me if he went out in some swashbuckling blaze of glory like a lot of people would've preferred, but his arc does suffer from the loss of one of the deleted scenes. What issue do you take with it?",hang-the-rules

It wasn’t something I appreciated enough as a child and found it boring to the absolute thrill ride that was DMD. I remember my mom loving it way more than I did, so perhaps she saw something in it that I couldn’t as a teen. 

Seeing it now, though, through the lens of both, an adult, and someone who loves the entire trilogy, I’ve really come to love Elizabeth’s transformation to Pirate King, Will’s shaky decent to traitor in his quest to save his dad, and everything that was Barbossa and Jack. It was even amazing to see the entire saga (a sad one, though) of of James Norrington reach an end, with his honor intact. 

I’ve almost even reached the point of liking it more than 2, but personally I find both equal in my book. My mom’s favorite is still the first, and while I concede it was much darker in tone than the last two (3 was a bit of a return to that dark tone) I simply like it.

Besides, I really love the third movie and I'm willing to overlook the flaws. It had so many memorable and great moments! Many of them are still used as quotes and memes! Being in people's minds after so many years is truly an achievement. No matter what you think about the trilogy, it delivered a fully consistent story with its beginning, climax, and ending.

Do I wish the end had all Pirate Ships vs the entire EIC fleet? Yes ofcourse. But I really enjoy how the film is a constant tide of tiny betrayals and agreements. The film's story constantly seems to change with each scene.

-Jack goes from returning from the dead to making a deal with Beckett, then helps the Brethren Cove unite, and ends up a prisoner momentarily nonetheless, finally sacrificing his dream of eternal life at sea to save a friend. 
-Will plays his own odds with his focus being his father, but he fits in well.

-Elizabeth has the best arc of the film for me, losing her father, being mistaken for Calypso, becoming a pirate lord, and then finding some sort of happiness with Will.

-All the supporting characters are brilliant, Davy Jones is menacing but you still pity him, Barbosa is savage and raw, and he has some of the best lines in the film. Even Gibbs and the crew do justice to their role.

Not many people know that people joined the pirates to get away from the British Navel Fleet which was a living nightmare to be a part of...not that you had a choice because they had all kinds of insane ways to force people to join. The conditions they forced sailors into were practically crimes against humanity.

The modern day equivalent would be if Amazon just straight tortured you or caused the deaths of its workers in order to go to war with all the competition. If [Walmart.com](https://Walmart.com) did something faster, they would literally work you, no matter the cost, to beat them. And you would be jailed or shot you if you tried to escape. So the workers band together and start looting Amazon warehouses for supplies needed to live and whatever else because FUCK Amazon.

Now just replace Jeff Bezos with the British monarchy and you pretty much have the same thing.

Disney was careful with this message because they pay their own employees a slave wage.

But the fact that those films are even watchable at all is a testament to how well they were directed and edited. And tbh I think people were a little too hard on them when they came out.

movies,lkv3gs,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End has one of the best openings to a sequel.,gnnakfp,2021-02-16 14:03:00,"I always thought that one of the main problems with PotC after 3 was the setting. Setting the original trilogy in the era of the death of piracy was great for dramatic effect, but after that particular story it erased most of the magic of the franchise.

Like, the reason why pirates + magic works so well is because it was a time period when the world was still not fully known, the oceans, islands, etc were not fully explored and registered, so you get the feeling of the unknown, that maybe there are still ancient secrets out there...but by movie 3 the world map is complete. Not only that, but pretty much every corner is ruled or controlled by someone (mainly the Indians Company, apparently). So you have these pirate adventures in a world that no longer has room for them, and inevitable story beats about trials, cities opening banks, etx. Too mundane. The world of pirates that was so appealing is gone, that world that was still kind of lawless and dangerous, but still magical.

I don't know if I'm making sense, but it would be like having an Indiana Jones movie set in the 70s: the world feels too real to have those magical, adventurous elements that work in the Nazi era, it simply doesn't work.

5 is my qualm-y one but that's only because of the compass. Really feel like they only added the captain giving Jack that compass to have the badass shot of him swinging it at Salazar. But this thread actually helped me solve my biggest problem with it.

So, Tia Dalma says she got Jack the compass but we learn in DMTNT that the captain of his 1st ship gave it to him. I contest that it is BOTH. 🤓

Jack got the compass from the captain, then lost it, as Jack is want to do. And I don't mean ""given away"", like it's implied breaks the curse, but he quite literally LOST it. Think about that. The compass points to what you want most and if Jack lost it, how would he ever be able to find it again? He lost his most important tool, his treasure finder, and couldn't ever find it again. So what's he to do? Go ask a swamp sorceress! That's where Tia Dalma comes in. SHE found Jack's compass again. No wonder he owes her so much.

It sets up the location and the setting beautifully, building the tension as you realise that the man we’ve been following is Bond, and not only that he’s after a target.

He finally reached the point for his attack. And then we cut. All that tension suddenly drops as we get normal ordinary cuts showing dialogue. The introspection of Bond on a hit goes. All the build up for absolutely nothing.

Long shots are a great technique when used well, but in Spectre it felt entirely masturbatory with no greater intention than “because we can”.

Compare with other long shot scenes and sequences like Children of Men, Birdman, and the funeral home episode of Haunting of Hill House where as a viewer you feel so trapped with these characters and so engrossed.

Heck the scene in Skyfall introducing Silva is a great example of a long shot. His dialogue as he slowly walks towards Bond, slightly out of focus most of the time so you can’t quite make him out until he is way too close. Beautiful.

I suppose as an opening scene reflective of the greater film an interesting premise with a disappointing payoff is appropriate.",Airules

5 is my qualm-y one but that's only because of the compass. Really feel like they only added the captain giving Jack that compass to have the badass shot of him swinging it at Salazar. But this thread actually helped me solve my biggest problem with it.

So, Tia Dalma says she got Jack the compass but we learn in DMTNT that the captain of his 1st ship gave it to him. I contest that it is BOTH. 🤓

Jack got the compass from the captain, then lost it, as Jack is want to do. And I don't mean ""given away"", like it's implied breaks the curse, but he quite literally LOST it. Think about that. The compass points to what you want most and if Jack lost it, how would he ever be able to find it again? He lost his most important tool, his treasure finder, and couldn't ever find it again. So what's he to do? Go ask a swamp sorceress! That's where Tia Dalma comes in. SHE found Jack's compass again. No wonder he owes her so. 

Therefore he never gave it away to break the curse and upend the 5th movie. He just lost it. Why? How?

We've been watching two movies about pirates and here's come the third to tell us ""Nope, the real world is coming."" And it does by showing us that Cutler Beckett would happily kill a child, as long as that child is a pirate. It unsettles you as the viewer because YOU have been sympathizing with pirates for the last 5 hours and what do you hear is a crime of piracy?

>""Sympathizing with a pirate.

So now that means WE, the audience, can be hanged. You start asking yourself questions because now YOU are there. Then the kid sings and it sets a tingle because we know the bones of the song so when the ""Yo-ho"" hits we get sucked even farther back to the 1st movie. And once every single pirate starts doing it do you understand. No, no, no, no, this isn't a song. It's a call. A chant. Magic. You're drawn further in. After all, your life is in danger because of sympathizing, why not go that step farther. You need this song to work as much as them. You're starting... to *believe*.

But WAIT! Look there's the asshole from the last movie who made all this happen and hold on. He's not effected? This is fucking freaking you out as the audience member and it's not doing a thing to the villain. He should know the implications more, and we find he does.  With a single word.

2+3 focused on the East India Trading Company using the knowledge the pirates had known for years to rule the sea and eventually the world. Which you see in 3 where they have almost complete control over most things, even the government. With only the  Brethren Court and the remaining pirates being the last example. Which they knew, so they did killed as much as they could (alongside gathering the Brethren Court).   


4 focused on the aftermath of all this. If legends are real, could immortality be real. The fountain of youth be a thing. Alongside this, most pirates seem to have been eradicated and only the real strong, such as Blackbeard and his magical abilities, being able to sail the seas without being stopped by the military. Also why its set away mostly from the mainland and on a distant island, since the adventures 1-3 had on normal land could not exist due to the changing of the world (something you see at the start).

WTF was that all about? There was subtly to Jack masked by Depp's over the top performance because he was written seriously. The writing of the other characters is crucial in allowing Jack to flourish. He got more screentime in 2 and 3 but the writing was still good enough for Depp to deliver genuine humour and elements of actual drama.

Pirates 5 is the only one to make me dislike Jack because his only joke is that he's drunk. The opening scene with him dragged on so much and that was the same for the rest of his performance.

His whole thing is he creates a somewhat chaotic situation to throw everyone off and then takes advantages as they present themselves.

Look at Davy Jones. He's an entirely CGI character, and in a film 14 years old but he's flawless. The attention to detail is astounding.

The kraken attack on the merchant ship, that wasn't entirely CGI - they built a full-scale model ship, filled a pipe with concrete and dropped it on top. Then they just had to replace the tentacle.

I learned about the gig from a public casting call on Craigslist for ""pirate-y"" people who are skinny, amputated, missing eyes, lots of facial hair, tattooed, etc.

I took my own headshot and got really positive feedback since I was 6'4"" and 135 lbs. They scheduled a follow-up costume session, where a costume designer dressed me in tattered Caribbean clothes.

Day of the shoot, call time was 4-5am at Disney's nature ranch north of LA. It was still dark when we were shuttled onto a bus and driven to a literal tent city the size of a warehouse!

Dressing and making-up hundreds of extras was extremely well organized, efficient, and fun :) We had a ticket that connected us with our previously selected costume. Then entered a massive tent with rows and rows of make-up artists. I got scars and dirt painted on, but the worst part was having your teeth painted black.

After that, we were sent to a large holding tent for extras. In the middle was a massive cornucopia of catered foods like out of a fantasy movie! But no one cared yet because they were packed liked sardines around the only tiny hose pumping warm air into a tent that was 20-30 degrees F.

Once shooting started, they'd call for groups of us...20...30...etc. to come stand in a line for the gallows. We'd sometimes walk slowly or stand in background shots. It wasn't hard, just tedious to endure in skimpy clothes as frigid winds whipped through the set.

One of my fav memories was once the day warmed up and the sun came out, pirate extras went outside to throw a football around in their full costumes, which was a hilarious contrast watching them do something so modern!",slyweazal

The only people who knew about magic were the people who had directly interacted with the cursed gold, or directly interacted with people who had interacted with the gold. Ergo, the world was not magic, only the gold was magic. It was not a fantasy movie, it was a pirate movie with a single fantasy element.

It's the Raiders of the Lost Ark formula. The presence of a magical ark does not make the world a fantasy world. The world is presented as just being the same world you and I live in, except with these one or two magical things in it.

This matters because the entire tone of the movie is informed by its setting. The nature of the setting changing between movies changes the whole experience.

I didn't mind cheesiness -- Barbosa always stole the show for me -- but it's gotta feel within that realm of silly too. Enough to laugh with the cheesy lines.

I mean it just honestly seemed historically out of place. Like from what I checked the last film was set around the time the whole concept of accusing people for witchcraft was fading out. I think honestly it would've worked better if they just kept it as a 'You can't do science you're a woman!' rather than trying to throw in the witchcraft because afaik what she did is sort of like an important part of sailing ships anyway?

Also I mean with the drunk Jack thing it was more the way they played it and tried to make it into one long drawn out 'lol jack is drunk' joke it made me cringe and it just wasn't that funny?

It's a bit like how I felt about Fat Thor in Avengers where I didn't necessarily think Thor kind of falling off the wagon was a bad idea it was more the way it was constantly being played for laughs of 'lol this character is fat' especially when contrasted to how the other characters had their trauma reactions portrayed in more realistic/sympathetic lights.",nocte_lupus

and it sounds like paying the actors and production crew cost a lot of money. roughly $400 million for that whole movie and Depp got $55.5 million, almost 8% of the budget was solely paying Depp, add in the rest of the co-stars and actors as well as production crew, that alone is a lot of the budget. 

Stranger tides also filmed in 3D which apparently isn’t cheap. “On Stranger Tides was filmed in 3D rather than using post-production conversion (except for one sequence). This increase filming cost considerably, while also complicate the shooting process. Especially in outdoor or underwater scene. Preparing and moving logistics across multiple premise also increase spending.”


some sources even claim the final production costs were $410.6 million, and that originally it had a budget of $300 million. and that this was after they tried to cut the budget down. i also read that they even moved primary production to cheaper locations (Hawaii and London, taxes aren’t as harsh there apparently)to save money. they also had to edit while filming, again to save time and money. this movie also ended up with less special effects and a shorter shooting schedule. they also received a $32.1 million rebate from the British government. 

“Even counting the $32.1 million rebate bringing the net total down to $378.5 million, it is still the most expensive move ever made, even after adjusting for inflation”

We've been watching two movies about pirates and here's come the third to tell us ""Nope, the real world is coming."" And it does by showing us that Cutler Beckett would happily kill a child, as long as that child is a pirate. It unsettles you as the viewer because YOU have been sympathizing with pirates for the last 5 hours and what do you hear is a crime of piracy?

>""Sympathizing with a pirate.

So now that means WE, the audience, can be hanged. You start asking yourself questions because now YOU are there. Then the kid sings and it sets a tingle because we know the bones of the song so when the ""Yo-ho"" hits we get sucked even farther back to the 1st movie. And once every single pirate starts doing it do you understand. No, no, no, no, this isn't a song. It's a call. A chant. Magic. You're drawn further in. After all, your life is in danger because of sympathizing, why not go that step farther. You need this song to work as much as them. You're starting... to *believe*.

But WAIT! Look there's the asshole from the last movie who made all this happen and hold on. He's not effected? This is fucking freaking you out as the audience member and it's not doing a thing to the villain. He should know the implications more, and we find he does.  With a single word.

In this situation, however, he had just recently lost control of the *Dutchman*. The enemies he is facing are behaving, from his perspective, irrationally and chaotically. They have completely upended his expectations, and he is suddenly faced with a *combat* decision in a moment where he has completely lost control.

The more they threw in, the more everything became unbelievable or simply too difficult to follow.

The Pirates brought in a pitcher called “The Nightmare”.  In about 9 pitches, he shut down the Reds with 100 mph heaters. You could feel hope starting to grow again in the stands. 

In between the 8th and 9th innings, they played the “Hoist the Colors” clip and the Buccs girls came running out into the stands waving these huge Pirates flags. We all started chanting “Hoist the colors” and “Let’s Go Buccs”.  It was an incredibly stirring moment.  

The Pirates pitcher did not give up any runs at the top of the 9th. Our hope was growing. Then when the Buccs got up to bat, they started getting some base hits. A single tied up the game. Then a perfectly executed sac bunt to advance everyone to 2nd and 3rd.  And then...

They hit a single to left field and they won!!!

And then there were fireworks. 

It was the best night of baseball ever. 

I love that rallying scene from the movie. Gets me choked up every time.",thisisridiculiculous

“At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before.

Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!

Spears shall be shaken, shields be splintered,

A sword day, a red day, ere the sun rises!

Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

With that he seized a great horn from Guthláf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightaway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.

Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

Suddenly, the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be over taken.

Fey he seemed, or the battle fury of his fathers ran like new fire within his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a God of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shown like an image of the sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed.

For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath overtook them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.”",

And I think they filmed 2 & 3 at the same time, which can save a ton of money; and they re-used some elements from CotBP production.  
Now a couple years go bye, they want to make a new blockbuster with a director who’s previous biggest film was probably Chicago, and they started most of the production from scratch. I think that likely tied into the production troubles. The trilogy was among the biggest productions ever, and considering the technical achievement and the massive cast, it’s damn impressive they made it all for under a Billion.
  
Just my 2 cents on what you said. I’m a big fan of Verbinksi, what he achieved when given a movie ride for inspiration is quite incredible. And they still hold up incredibly well! One thing the trilogy does far better with than the later films, is blending the sets and characters with the CG. The art direction is incredibly consistent.

We were getting a new Mr Bean film, The Simpsons Movie, Transformers, a Fantastic Four sequel, Spider-Man 3, Shrek 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3, the next Harry Potter, Ghost Rider, a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film, the ""sequel"" to Shaun of the Dead, the next Die Hard film, the next Bourne film, a new Rush Hour, a sequel to Bruce Almighty, a National Treasure sequel, the first Disney movie with hand drawn animation in several years, another Alien vs Predator movie, etc.

Granted all of them weren't winners but I've never felt so hyped up going into a year. 2019 was probably the next year that came close to feeling that way.",indianajoes

“At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:


*Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!
Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!
spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,
a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!
Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!*


With that he seized a great horn from Guthláf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.
Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and the darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.”",DaLB53

The romance between the priest and the mermaid is cringe and extremely uninteresting. It develops without any meaning and out of the blue. Both of their characters are one-dimensional, lack any depths, and are deprived of any real developement in the movie. The whole thing makes me groan every time.   
   
BUT   
   
The movie has so many great moments, it redeems itself in my opinion. The whole London sequence of Jack’s escape is such a blast to watch. The Queen Anne’s Revenge is great and so is Blackbeard, the shenanigans on the island are fun, I still laugh at Jack and those palm trees...  
   
The writing could have been way, way better for Penelope Cruz’s character especially (the fact that I still can’t recall her name is an indicator...) but her presence and meaning in the story is good enough.

Edit: Copy/paste from another comment where I solve the compass problem.

5 is my qualm-y one but that's only because of the compass. Really feel like they only added the captain giving Jack that compass to have the badass shot of him swinging it at Salazar. But this thread actually helped me solve my biggest problem with it.

So, Tia Dalma says she got Jack the compass but we learn in DMTNT that the captain of his 1st ship gave it to him. I contest that it is BOTH. 🤓

Jack got the compass from the captain, then lost it, as Jack is want to do. And I don't mean ""given away"", like it's implied breaks the curse, but he quite literally LOST it. Think about that. The compass points to what you want most and if Jack lost it, how would he ever be able to find it again? He lost his most important tool, his treasure finder, and couldn't ever find it again. So what's he to do? Go ask a swamp sorceress! That's where Tia Dalma comes in. SHE found Jack's compass again. No wonder he owes her so much. 

Therefore he never gave it away to break the curse and upend the 5th movie. He just lost it. Why? How? 

Cause he's Captain Jack Sparrow.",omegansmiles

The music, while not being Zimmer, is still very good.  Honestly opening scene in London with the king and re-introduction of Barbosa as a privateer is so entertaining, it does set the tone for the rest of the film as relatively fun, even if it's not as good as the first 3.

The thing is, words do have power, and when a word is used to put down a group of people repeatedly, it becomes a slur. The fact is, poof, when used as an insult IS A SLUR, whether you like it or not.

I’m sorry but i reallly love Shaun of the Dead, i teared up in my film class last year due to your performance being so good. I wondered if Ed’s farts were real in the movie.

Anyway, i’m a young filmmaker and have a couple questions i’d like to ask.

- As an actor, what does a script need to hook you in and instantly get you wanting to be a part of it?

- Is there any advice you could give to young filmmakers working with actors?

- What’s been your favorite movie to work on and why?

- Who’s been your favorite director to work with and why? (might be too obvious but curious)

- Can a mediocre script be saved by good acting?

- What does mean to have a GREAT script?

Thank you for your time and your wonderful performances, you’ve inspired me and many others to embrace this wonderful art called film.🙏",Pepperoni_Tony7

I remember meeting you in 2004/2005 when you were in London doing Signings for ""Shaun of the Dead"" I was about 12 or 13 at the time!

After signing my ""Shaun of the Dead"" graphic novel You asked for a 'High Five's and I did it!

As I moved over to Edgar Wright you said ""Hoo ow! And shook your hand"" as if it hurt.

It gave me a good chuckle and I've never forgotten it.

I still have the comic signed by you both.

I've recently gone back and watched the trilogy and have to say that it infuriated me how much Jack's character changed between the first two movies. In the first movie, Jack was a drunk and (more than a bit) clumsy but there always seemed to be a method to his madness and felt like he was always one step ahead. In Dead Man's chest he's turned into a comedic relief character who lucks his way through every situation. The change is especially jarring when you watch the first two movies back to back.",Crothfus

Two examples:
- in *At World’s End* they have an elaborate backstory between Jack, the East India Trading Company, and his refusal to trade people that resulted in his branding. Tell that story! Don’t leave it as subtext
- *Dead Men Tell No Tales* had Javier freakin Bardem as an awesome sea captain get outmaneuvered and an army crippled by Jack in a flashback! I would have been much more interested in that than the trident of destiny mcguffin thing.

Also, the main characters were great but the whole Pirates trilogy doesn't get enough credit for the writing of the minor characters like Gibbs, Pintel, Cotton, Swann, and the two British soldiers.

I personally think CoTBP would have been fine on its own no sequels but that's not the Disney way, success = sequel it seems. And they paid off imo. 

But I feel like most people's gripes from my experience are that it's not the cgi, the story, the new characters but Jack Sparrows character development.
In the first movie, he may be a bit flamboyant and like a loose cannon but he always has a plan and/or an ulterior motive. With the whole stealing the interceptor scene for example.
But in 2 and 3 he just becomes more and more ridiculous with things just sort of panning out good for him by chance, it's more luck than planning for example the tribe island in 2 and the God damn world's end crab boat thing in 3. It feels like they went ""okay Johnny do it just like you did first time but.. More"".

Bill Nighy’s performance as Davy Jones is stellar; the blend of his voice acting with the great visual effects make Davy Jones still one of my favorite villain representations in a long time. 

The stakes feel much higher in this movie and the character’s motivations really get dug into through the film. The themes of sacrifice running through Bootstrap and Jack and Davy Jones makes them feel like real characters with motivations rather than just pirates.

The 4th film in particular just felt lazy all around compared to those two.

Plus the last hour(ish) of At World's End, while over long, is something of a masterpiece in my mind.

By comparison - nobody needs to tell you CoBP is fantastic when ___ - it's just a great movie. Tight writing, good acting, good effects, etc.

The director, Gore Verbinski, started off as a visual effects artists himself, so he really knew exactly what was possible and how best to shoot each effects scene to get the most out of his artists.

On top of that, a lot of the effects were practical, rather than pure CG. This made the films *insanely* expensive, but it's what makes them look so great. For example, the scene where the kraken breaks the merchant ship in half? They built a full-scale model ship, filled a pipe with concrete and dropped it on top. The result is a scene which looks *amazing* because to all intents and purposes what you're seeing is actually happening, they just painted out the pipe and replaced it with tentacles.",DarkNinjaPenguin

Maybe its just because I hated the third film so much but I found *On Stranger Tides* refreshing; the ending scene also concludes Jack's story arch involving his search for immortality.

The first three are solid narratively because of the two leads:  Elizabeth and Will. They both have goals and drive and great character development.

Jack is not a main character. He is a plot device. A really damned good plot device, but his character is not suited to serving as the primary protagonist.

The amount of planning, crossing, double crossing, making deals, breaking them, stealing, buying, hiding, finding, made it really interesting to follow and try and work out the best outcome for everyone.

That had it's charms but let's not let nostalgia distract us from the fact that the potholes where brutal. 

When they introduced Tia Dalma in Dead Man's Chest she makes comments about Davy Jones that don't make sense by any standard as if the writers at this point didn't know she would be revealed as Calypso. There is a point where a character isn't written as a good liar but appears in retrospect unaware of its own background. 

In fact everything todo with Calypso makes no sense. She has no impact on the story considering her insane power level. She throws a massive temper tantrum in form of a storm but that's it. It's not targetted and there is no further effect. She's not taking revenge she's just making a fancy swirly for the battle to have stakes. It also seems to have no long term effect on the universe that they fucking released a sea god that supposedly made the waters significantly harder to sail for pirates. Calypso isn't just chaotic evil, she's completely confused chaotic evil. She does things. Because she does them. Because she's the sea *it doesn't have to make sense* (were practically getting beaten over the head with the lampshading for lazy writing). 

And Davy Jones villain motive is that he's kinda got hit over the head too. The first part, sure, makes sense, where he gets supposedly betrayed by his godlover that he sold his soul to (!) so he gets a lot of pirates to work together and imprison her (nevermind for a second we're supposed to brush over the fact that he has no reason to know how to do that). But then, after half an eternity of being screwed over and screwing people over because he's still bound to the vow he made to her (and she crapped over hard) all she needs to do is say ""whelp, ya know, I kinda love you but I'll always be an abusive bitch, which you can't be mad about because you should have known"" for him to go ""yeah, makes sense. I love again, notice me senpai."" I've seen octopus solve complex puzzles, so if anyone wants to blame the tentacle brain for this degree of stupid, I'm calling bs.

Calypso was a plot device they did so badly.

EDIT: And i'm sparing you all a similar rant for the whole jack-will-liz triangle that only exists for pointless sexual tension and lovers quarrel. It's completely nonsensical even by teen drama standards and severely hurts the character consistency of Elizabeth.",Quantentheorie

They were all debating releasing her because they *didn't* know what she was going to do. Some said that she would be grateful. Others said she was still their enemy. Essentially, no agreement was made.  
  
Then Barbossa said 'screw this' and trapped and planned to release Calypso anyway with the intention of ""I'll release her and she'll help me out"". That...*kind of* worked, just not as intended. They did release her but nothing really happened except she caused a storm for the final fight. Hence the 'what now?' from some of the pirates and some replied ""Nothing. It didn't work.""

Nah bro we're gonna fight to the last breath""  which was *also* the point of the storm-for them to fight it out. And then they beat the dutchman and won the fight.

The first movie is about a young naive boy joining up with a smuggler to stop an evil juggernaut with supernatural forces. Smuggler is obsessed with the fastest ship around. They take the ship to do things, implied the smuggler really only cares about money. Boy almost gets the girl (who is essentially a princess) throughout. References to a lineage. Rag tag group take on big evils and the ""empire.""

Second movie Who is my daddy? Meet my Daddy. Get his dagger thing. Also, let's go to a swamp to visit a wise old supernatural being who will tell us about destiny and fate. Boy loses girl to smuggler, smuggler dies...ish in a cliffhanger end...but everyone agrees to go rescue him in the next movie. We mix plots a bit here in that an old bargain by the smuggler is the core issue here, not as much the being chased by the Empire...but both are present. Old smuggling friends brought into the fold (whether Norrington is a Lando substitute is arguable). We also have a weird Ewok crossover here instead of the third movie. So it goes.

Uh oh, big angry Empire is back, let's go get a big coalition of previously unknown but similar anti-Empire folk. Also need to rescue the smuggler. On the way, let's resolve the princess and smuggler romance to get the love triangle out of the way. Big ship battle at the end which seemingly ends the Empire. Boy makes tragic sacrifice (gets the girl sorta...so that's a change), saves father from his supernatural eternal doom. Defeats the bigger grislier evil and becomes the sole weilder of the supernatural power.

The process of banner becoming professor hulk isnt quite that interesting, its more seeing the hulk be the way he is in Endgame thats the pay off for me. The hulks characters grows and changes but is still there affecting the plot and moving the story forward. Professor Hulk being the one to do the snap, there fore kind of fullfilling the idea tony had in avengers 1, that Banner was given this power for a reason. Thats the crux of and climax of his story.

on the other hand the kraken is just 100% killed and it never affects anything ever again after being this massive doomsday plot device in movie 2",dejerik
