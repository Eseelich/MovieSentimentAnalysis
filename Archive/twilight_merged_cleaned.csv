I was into the Teams and all that. I made fan art. Now at 38, I‚Äôm thinking ‚ÄúBella‚Äôs parents needed to keep a better eye on her‚Äù. Her mom was so flightly and tried to be her friend.

1hdozb0,Rewatching Twilight as an adult,m1yutxg,2024-12-14 03:46:42,"I just rewatched it (yay, free YouTube movies!) at my big age of 31, and I have no idea why Bella was interested in Edward. He was so rude to her in the beginning, so hot and cold, so temperamental; not to mention the gaslighting followed up by ‚Äúnobody will believe you‚Äù‚Ä¶if he wasn‚Äôt supernaturally attractive I‚Äôm positive she would‚Äôve given him a wide berth.",melodysmomma
1hdozb0,Rewatching Twilight as an adult,m1zcle5,2024-12-14 06:19:40,"You have a good point:

>Their bond, the way they protect and love each other unconditionally, and the sacrifices they make as a family

Even though most of think its a bad idea, they still back Edward. Esme's whole line in Twlight ""She's with Edward now"". Yeah. That really hit me when watching. Like even though Rosalie didn't like it, she did it anyway and trusted Esme and Carlise.

The first movie just hits right, even the cringe parts. Then after that, its not a hate watch because the movies have a good premise, but its not all the enjoyable anymore. The middle, watching them, is very meh. I do it. I own all of them and I have no regrets buying blu-ray and on Primes. Both Christmas gifts too. I have at least an annual rewatch during the summer. Normally two. But its mainly to just do a proper complete marathon for the sake of a marathon. Just to make it to Breaking Dawn properly without skipping the middle because it doesn't feel right. I also like the ending of New Moon.

But I think as a romance reader and mainly a paranormal romance reader (thank you Twilight and Stephanie Meyer for sending my spiraling), it hits just right. All the right points for a happily ever after.

And I admiteddly do watch just the end for the ending credits. I'll even pull them up on Youtube sometimes. I cry every time at the end of Breaking Drawn Part II. Same with the Hobbit. But it is wrapped up beautifully. And Stephanie Meyer's story, for me, is a masterpeice.",BloodyWritingBunny
1hdozb0,Rewatching Twilight as an adult,m21lzp2,2024-12-14 17:44:41,"I believe the unity of the Cullens was a huge attraction for Bella. Growing up as she did, as an only child with divorced parents she never had anything like it. Even if Edward had left her, had she had the rest of the family she would have done okay.

I first watched it when i was 14(?) and as a 19 yo i watched again and decided to read the books. I didn't even finish the first book-i am reading the first book and midnight sun at the same time- and while reading the midnight sun every time i think ""Ohhh edward's family is going to be soooo mad/judgemental about this"" they prove me wrong. I swear the god i feel like crying everytime i read esme's thoughts. She is so supportive. Her excitement when edward is happy, her thrill when bella came home for the first time... Rosalia is the only exepition i think. She is so full of herself it is annoying. The motive behind her acts is always so selfish.",islandtheslayer
1hdozb0,Rewatching Twilight as an adult,m1z9kis,2024-12-14 05:50:04,"I was in my early 20s when the movies blew up. So, right around the book age of Bella, year wise. I have a natural aversion to bandwagon jumping, and am an adamant book-before-movie person, so it wasn‚Äôt until my mid 20s that I went through all the books and my late 20s (maybe just 30) that I watched the movies.

The romance part was never the main draw for me, though I agree it‚Äôs epic, for lack of a better word. All the side characters, the read-between-the-lines lore, and yes, the cohesive found family, were what really drew me in. And I‚Äôm still searching for the right persuasive argument to get my partner to give the books a chance, because I think he‚Äôll like a lot of it, despite the ‚Äúsparkles‚Äù that are all he‚Äôs managed to absorb of the story.

Now? I don‚Äôt like Jacob even more haha. But for more reasons I didn‚Äôt think about as much when I was young. The SA, for example. The childishness, the manipulative shit, the extreme selfishness he possesses. The whole of Eclipse was ruined by Jacob‚Äôs arrogant, gross personality.

But at the same time, I go back and I read the books and watch the movie and remember there wouldn't be much they could have done at that point. She was already 18, so legally, she could have done whatever she wanted. She was also so stubborn and sassy about it too in the books. The way she talks to Charlie about how her and Edward are a package deal, and if he can't handle that she understood and was willing to move out. I was just wanting Bella to slow down at that point.",Overall_Lake_3563
1hdozb0,Rewatching Twilight as an adult,m1zen7s,2024-12-14 06:40:44,"Eh I disagree, Bella was already hyper independent from taking care of her mom. When she moved back with Charlie she shifted that dynamic on to him by cooking for him. Also the fact that she strictly thinks of her parents by their first names rather than their family titles, shows she was already separate from both of them. 

And Charlie tried to ground her and
Keep her away from Edward but she was 18 and told him point blank that if he tried she would move in with the Cullens immediately. He just wanted to keep her close. He grounded her for a short time and she went along with it bc Edward could still visit, but he stopped it bc he thought it was detrimental more than anything that she wouldn‚Äôt see Jacob or any of her other friends. So I can‚Äôt blame Charlie for not reigning her in, after living away from him for so long there was already that degree of separation, and she had more of an adult relationship with him rather than a parent/child relationship.


My only criticism of Charlie is the way he reacted when she told him Jacob kissed her unwillingly and she broke her hand punching him. He laughed it off and seemed like he was glad Jacob kissed her. Said something about ‚ÄúEdward not being able to handle a little competition.‚Äù That was annoying, bc he didn‚Äôt care or respect her choices",jupitermoonflow

She‚Äôs also obsessed with her looks and views other women as competition. She‚Äôs practically a complete stereotype.

Eclipse-Jacob's immoral acts aren't _right_, but they _make sense_. To a point where I don't buy the popular ""Meyer purposefully assassinated his character"" take. It's actually a very realistic and natural way of how Jacob would react to his predicament, with Bella's heart being supernaturally eclipsed, her impending death, etc. 

Going off of that, none of these characters are role models, and we can't realistically project real world psychology onto them. Edward is not just an old creep, he's the trapped spirit of a 17-year-old, forever frozen in time. Jacob is not just some rapey jock, he's a young man cursed with the knowledge that he had a soul mate in this life but it was stolen away by supernatural influences. Bella isn't just some selfish brat, she's a girl torn apart by two incompatible lives and the two hearts in her chest. Meyer even spelled it out in New Moon, when she said that Bella could not explain her issues to a therapist with the needed honesty, since the supernatural insanity of her problems would just get her locked away. 

Breaking Dawn doesn't just break the dawn but also the series. Its Forever Dawn roots make every last character feel completely alien and regressed, like you're suddenly reading an entirely different series, and the decline in writing quality from Eclipse to it is _staggering_. I sometimes feel a bit crazy for seemingly being the only one who notices that, but then I check out old reviews online and find my people, ranting about the very same betrayal they felt. I guess they just moved on afterward, but I sadly love the trilogy, and some of its spin-offs, too much to do that. 

Because the initial Twilight trilogy is genuinely, unironically amazing, _especially_ New Moon and Eclipse, and just straight up doesn't deserve most of the hate and dismissal it faces, which, from my analysis, is a mix of brainless misogyny and the unfortunate consequences of Breaking Dawn and the baby/imprinting plot, which even main actors like Robert Pattinson got fed up with, and which tanked the series's reputation in a way that's become hard to rebuke, even for fans.",Slashycent

All criticisms that it is an ""unhealthy relationship"" or that they are ""boring"" fully miss the point that the story is simply a powerful tale about destiny and how insane being TRULY in love makes you. As a result of this, I see Jacob as a totally illegitimate love interest because of the fact that he and Bella aren't destined for each other. Jacob represents a type of filial love that is still special, but Bella and Edward's INSANE all consuming love for each other will always be a different level. The ""healthier option"" or whatever completely negates Bella's agency to be insane, which is both her choice and her destined compulsion and purpose of life.",giveemhellkid

1et5uxt,What Twilight opinion will leave you in this position?,linmz9v,2024-08-18 02:06:01,"Charlie's reaction to Jacob kissing Bella against her will was absolutely terrible writing on SM's part, for multiple reasons. 

Reason #1: It's completely out of character. I don't care how much Charlie liked Jacob, the freaking CHIEF OF POLICE would NEVER react that way to any boy kissing his daughter against her will. 

  
Reason #2: It really made the entire situation seem like SM herself didn't even understand that she just wrote an SA scene... 

Because it basically ended up being that the ONLY person who saw that situation accurately was Edward. And because Edward has major bias, his opinion on that matter could easily be passed off as jealousy. 

  
What I would have LOVED to see, and what would have made me love and respect Charlie greatly instead of being disgusted by him, would be if Charlie was absolutely livid with Jacob. That would have been so impactful in so many ways. Because since Charlie loved Jake so much and was rooting for him to end up with his daughter, if even HE was pissed at Jake for this, that would have made it crystal clear to any young person reading the book that what Jacob did was NOT okay. It was so bad that even the people who love him and are rooting for him are rightfully pissed and disappointed by his behavior. 

  
That whole situation was just a mess. It really felt like SM didn't even see that event as SA. Because it wasn't just the characters reacting poorly, it was the entire situation being passed off as not that big of a deal, especially when I'm pretty sure BELLA HERSELF makes a dark joke in her mind that her dad should probably arrest her for assaulting Jacob. That part in particular made my jaw drop and made me realize SM has no idea what she just wrote. The fact that even Bella thought that SHE was in the wrong, and even used the word assault to describe HER behavior but not Jacob's, is wild.",

So, how is she powerful in a world where basically everyone is physically stronger than her?

Wits + strong relationships +grit.

When she cuts her arm to distract the vampires in Eclipse, she only knows about this because the werewolves liked and cared for her enough to share their legends with her. 

It‚Äôs pretty fucking smart and she changed the tide in a way only *she* could.

That was a moment of power and agency.

I also really loved how she played an incredibly vital role in the final almost showdown with the Volturi.

In her defense, I will say, as an author who has written a love triangle before, it does get a little stressful sometimes when you're worried that the readers are going to love one of the guys so much that they will be mad at you for making the girl end up with the other one in the end. lol So I can see the temptation to just make one of the guys absolute trash, so the other one is the obvious choice. But personally I think that's the easy/lazy way out. I prefer love triangles where both options are good people and would have been fine choices. I find that more realistic, anyway. Because there are plenty of people I've dated who I probably could have been perfectly happy with if we had stayed together. I don't believe my husband is the only good guy I could have possibly been happy with.",

1et5uxt,What Twilight opinion will leave you in this position?,licwidd,2024-08-16 04:42:20,"I've been considering this for a while. It was going to take place in a world sort of like a mashup of Twilight, Supernatural, and Criminal Minds.

Supernaturals aren't that common in this world. Witches are probably the most common (pagan, cult, whatever), but they only manage small spells, rituals, and stuff like that. They act like real world witches. There are other witches, of course, and they have real power. These type of witches created vampires and werewolves. Shapeshifters exist. So do ghosts, demons (they're kinda spiritual, not actual physical beings), fairies (also spirits), and other similar beings. Currently debating on angels because I don't necessarily want to go the Christian or divinity route. Might just make them the opposite of demons and refer to them as angels, to be honest.

There's a secret sect of government that oversees crimes done by supernaturals, called the Supernatural Investigations Unit (professionally called the Special Investigations Unit). This sect also creates IDs for the ""immortals"", or at least the ones they know of, and keep an eye on them. You know, to make sure they're not eating people. The SIU sort of acts like J Jenks and the Volturi combined, but less evil.

It's also not illegal to let ""civillians"" in the know, but it's preferable not to in order to prevent mass hysteria. Also, the civies involved end up dying or becoming nonhuman themselves.

My ""Twilight"" was going to have that small town charm with some supernatural vibes. I was going to make it pretty light-hearted, with no love triangle and angsty stuff. The FMC is going to be your average human woman while the MMC isn't some centuries-old vampire. Actually, I was going to make it so there were a few types of vampires, those cursed, turned, or born. The MMC was going to be turned.

Cursed vampires are the immortal ones, while the turned have a normal-ish lifespan (depending on how they maintain themselves), and the born ones are dhampirs (female vampires cannot concieve and most males are sterile, depends on how and by whom they got turned). The vampires who are turned are technically still living, which is why they still age, albeit slowly. Their bodily functions just slowly break down until they're reliant entirely on blood. So new-turned vampires can still eat like normal, but the older they get, the less they can ingest normally and the more blood they need to drink. These older ones also age more and more like normal, so they're less ""young"" and ""pretty"" than new-turns.",CyberWolfWrites

Charlie was able to not only live alone but also take care of his own elderly parents for a time. And obviously he knew that Renee was the type of person who always needed someone to take care of her because he was married to her. (I find it to be a really interesting similarity between Bella and Charlie that they're used to to taking care of others; Charlie out of necessity and Bella just because that's her personality due to having grown up with Rennee) So Bella offering to do it probably gave some indicator to him that she had to grow up fast having lived with Renee her whole life. It makes sense to me that as a divorced father, having your kid come live with you permanently for the first time in their life, you'd try to adapt to how they're used to living with their other parent. I don't think it was entirely responsible on his part but he's clearly not used to being her primary gaurdian so he might not feel comfortable enforcing proper boundaries between parent and child.

they shouldn't be, and then saying he couldn't stay away from her. He never trusted her decisions and always tried to convince her to do what he wanted her to do instead.

Also, as for Alice she even says herself that she was looking for ‚Äúsomething she couldn‚Äôt see‚Äù and blind spots as she *can‚Äôt see them*. Alice can only see humans because she was one, and vampires because she is one. She cannot see the shifters or the hybrids at all, in fact they even give her headaches which she complains about.

And then keeping my eyes open all the time in case you decided to throw me any more instructions. At some point you‚Äôre going to have to tell me what exactly is in Rio. Before any of that, I had to try to see every trick the Volturi might come in with and give you what few clues I could so you would be ready for their strategy, and I only had just a few hours to trace out all the possibilities. Most of all, I had to make sure you‚Äôd all believe that I was ditching out on you, because Aro had to be positive that you had nothing left up your sleeves or he never would have committed to an out the way he did.

It‚Äôs one thing to desire love and a family as a part of your life, but that was Rosalie‚Äôs entire character. Literally all she wanted in her human life (and all she wants in her vampire life) was a husband to take care of her and provide her with money and to have babies. She doesn‚Äôt have any friends, and doesn‚Äôt attempt to communicate with anyone outside of her family. And even then, she typically acts indifferent or even hostile towards them at times. We know she plays the piano, but other than that what hobbies does she have? She plays baseball with the fam occasionally, and likes to drive flashy sports cars? It would be one thing completely if she wanted a full life that included romance, children, hobbies, friends and a career. But she doesn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs essentially one dimensional, again due to Stephenie Meyer‚Äôs writing and old fashioned values, and I just find her character such a disappointment honestly. Plenty of strong, feminist women will get married and have kids, but when it comes to a vast majority of women, that isn‚Äôt all they want from life. And it‚Äôs not just Rosalie either. Every single female character Meyer writes tends to revolve around a male character in some way. The pack is constantly complaining about having Leah around because apparently Sam is literally all she ever thinks about. Poor freakin Emily is trapped with the guy who stalked her and I guess just stays at his house all day making food for the horde of shirtless teenage boys because they‚Äôve like adopted them?? Still not sure why they can‚Äôt make their own food considering she‚Äôs only supposed to be like 2-3 years older than them. Even Bella had little to no ambitions before meeting Edward. She was just like ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll become a teacher like my mom?‚Äù And based her college decision process on how sunny and warm the climate was because the school itself didn‚Äôt matter.

I looked it up a while ago and I know a little because the HP fandom has adopted the Wheel of the Year. Could you explain the difference between Wiccans and pagans?

Concerning the angels, I was thinking of going the Greek daimon route. The benevolent ones are our angels and the malevolent ones are our demons. I'm debating on comparing them to Jinn, as well.

I'm currently not sure what to do about heaven and hell. It's so prevalent in today's society that some form of it must exist. Maybe I'll make it a concept that shifts depending on one's beliefs. Souls are separate from memory, so the memory of that one person dictates where they go while the soul reincarnates - or turns into an angel or demon.

I'm mostly concerned about where to go about different deities. Do I include the gods as witches who've ascended due to their powers, or do I make them daimons? What about God?

I've considered different ideas about how to God, although I'm not sure which I should choose. One idea was to have ""God"" as an idea or a force, nothing from which the universe was created but not necessarily a person. This sprung into my other idea, which was to have God separate into different beings as cultures and religions expand. So in Greek mythology, God would start as Chaos and evolve into Gaia, Tartarus, et cetera.",CyberWolfWrites

I don't think there's anything wrong with characters prioritizing the lives of one's family over strangers. The Cullens made the same call in Twilight or Eclipse. I'll agree there's a communication issue on SMeyer's part (e.g. Bella claiming the Cullens protect humans on the same page Edward said the newborn in Seattle wasn't their problem), but their actions are consistent. They live their lives their way and don't judge other vampires for living differently.


Carlisle's friendships with murderers is strange, I'll admit. I don't have an answer for that.

I'm can honestly say I was brought up as a Presbyterian and had to attend church/sunday school until I turned 18... for me I always thought it a load of hogwash that never sat well with me, I've only ever stepped foot in a church since for weddings/funerals/christenings.  We didn't have any religious 'angels' and that was after having read the bible in the later years of attending sunday school.  My mum was an Elder of the church so all us kids whose parents were Elders went to Sunday school... boring!!!

You're correct Wicca is a relatively new thing that was made up from a few Pagans who wanted 'witchcraft' along with white and black magic.   I'm 64 and have been a pagan for at least 40yrs now, we worship mother nature believing her to be 'the' ultimate spirit (using worship here as lack of a better word)   
Before any form of Christianity everyone was a pagan, as with the Catholic church, when it first was invented by whoever Priests were allowed to marry, visit brothels and satisfy their needs.  It's only in modern times that it became that a Priest would have all ties with God, hence why there has been so many babies remains dug up from underneath even modern day Convents.  Alot once used to have tunnels from Presbetries to Convents as they were always so close to each other but couldn't be seen entering each others place.

Being a pagan can range from many beliefs of dieties eg: Norse, Ancient Greece, Roman and Egyptian all of who have many dieties.  The one thing that paganism or should I say Christianity as it's much newer than pagan beliefs is that the Christian calendar falls upon many of the old pagan holidays eg:  Christmas  in the northern hemisphere is Yule, Easter falls in Spring which was when the pagans celebrate the goddess Estore... so the Wheel of the Year has been around for centuries as it does refer to seasons and the equinoxes as they fall in the Nothern Hemisphere... it is all the opposite for those of us that live in the Southern Hemisphere.     
Wicca would've taken on the Wheel of the Year so they can celebrate the equinoxes in particular.  You'll find the majority of pagans do nothing it's just that they do not believe in Christian/Islam etc religions, or God.  
Wicca on the other hand (which I did follow as a solitary white witch) is where you cast a circle, have the a candle for north, south, east, west... you chant and 'cast' spells.  I practiced it religiously for 12mths many many years ago in my very early 20's and thought it a load of hogwash... just my opinion... as they worship both the goddess and horned god (not the devil).  I wasn't comfortable worshipping a horned god and never included anything for one on my alter.   

Then you have Wiccans that practice black magic and spells (in my eyes if a spell works it's a coincidence) alot of Wiccans worship in covens, the minimum number to make a coven is 3 and different covens will have usually a set amount of people that can join, 13 is a popular number.  They wear caped cloaks and as a rule are naked underneath, some covens practice magic nude others in cloaks... each coven will usually have it's own rules.  

I have seen that black magic is being taught to quite alot of youngsters in the US which why any parent would want their child at a young age of under 10 to be influenced by a devil has got me beat!

I think that whatever you decide upon in you book that you'll do what's you and that's good... no matter how God may shift to a different one etc.. and the same with angels.  I honestly can't remember if Wicca believes in angels... I read up so on so much of it when I had my toddlers (I was a young mum) my children still have never known that I practiced Wicca all those years ago, but do no that I'm pagan and think that my beliefs in many things such as fate and other things that I'm quite batty... lol

I did ask my kids when they were younger if they wanted to attend church as we lived over the road from a very old quaint Church of England, they never had any interest I will admit that I did tell them that I'd take them and pick them up tho... lol

I believe religion is something you choose and is not forced down your throat like it was with me, my hubby is also pagan we have a so called alter which many pagans do but it's really only got things on it that we like, I have some crystals in a bowl, some shells a few feathers and a fairy that I fell in love with when my daughter passed away... hubby's side has got a piece of driftwood and a wooden Norse valknut I had made for him (3 interlocking triangles) he doesn't practice anything but has always had a fascination with Norse mythology where I have read up on the majority of either ancient religions/beliefs and even modern day ones.

Sorry this was so long winded and I'd love to read your book once you've completed it... I'm sure you'll make changes along the way of writing it, explore every idea that you have and see what you feel works and will grab peoples attentions.",tijim_

1fib7el,What‚Äôs your most cringe-worthy Twilight moment?,lnmnev4,2024-09-17 20:32:15,"Uhhh‚Ä¶ Stalking a person to the point of hanging out in their bedroom uninvited while they sleep, when you barely even know them too, is not objectively a normal or healthy thing to do. Or following them to another town to keep them safe when they haven‚Äôt asked you to. All of Edward‚Äôs bad traits are painted as romantic and such, and ignored as an actual problem, but realistically they are. A man doing those things in the real world is grounds for a restraining order. One can try to sweep it under the rug because of the context of the story, but thinking critically about what kind of relationship is being displayed and romanticized, it‚Äôs a super bad example to set and really not justifiable enough. 

Edward is also pretty controlling and manipulative towards Bella. He doesn‚Äôt like Jacob or think the wolves are safe, so he tries to keep her from them. Remember the removing of a car part so she literally couldn‚Äôt drive to see Jacob? Forget the fact that she‚Äôs known Jacob much longer than Edward as an important friend, and that they‚Äôre naturally enemies due to *vampires* traditionally murdering humans indiscriminately, and that Bella has and will be in many dangerous situations because she‚Äôs with Edward. Yeah, the wolves are the unsafe bad ones. Really, Edward‚Äôs basically just jealous and being controlling, making stupid excuses for it, and not caring about how cutting off contact from Jake would affect Bella. At the very least, she needs friends outside of Edward and his family.

Another sucky thing Edward does is breaking up with Bella over something he arguably should have seen coming, and wasn‚Äôt really all that bad if you think about the crap she already went through. Leaving her in the forest, lying to her in the cruel way he did that really took aim at the insecurities he certainly should have known about, and then going from not really allowing her to go anywhere without him stalking her for safety to her being alone in a field and almost getting murdered by Laurent. And wow, if it wasn‚Äôt for Jacob and his pack, she would be dead. After that, he should have been way nicer to Jacob except when Jacob was also being a creep. Even if you justify him not liking Jacob because of his romantic interest in Bella, being natural rivals, and Jacob not always taking no for an answer, it‚Äôs still Bella‚Äôs choice to make as far as spending time with him or not. He can express how he feels appropriately, but he can‚Äôt make the choice for her and behave in the way he does. Especially when he‚Äôs no saint and should know it. Glass houses and all that. 

He also cuts Bella off from Alice when he leaves. For someone who could and does cause so much trouble for Bella, and isn‚Äôt completely unaware of it, the good thing to do would have been to leave before it ever got as far as it did. Not after you‚Äôve already infiltrated her life like that.

I could actually go on a bit, but I‚Äôll stop. The ultimate thing with Twilight is that you need some warning and critical analysis before and after consuming it. It‚Äôs totally fine to enjoy in a lighthearted way, or whatever, as long as you know and understand that the relationships are not realistically healthy or to be emulated in real life. Like, I would never let my daughter read them as a teen or similarly aged without talking about things that happen that she shouldn‚Äôt settle or stand for in her own relationships. People do learn a lot from media as far as how to behave, what‚Äôs acceptable and not, and etc. Things are usually not *just* books or movies that you consume and then have zero impact on you after. Especially not when you‚Äôre young and impressionable and might go looking for your own Edward. The guy who seems like a hot and sexy bad/dangerous/wild/exciting boy is not always the healthiest choice. I would always hope that some way or another, people were aware that while twilight can be a good story and enjoyable, it‚Äôs not without flaws and should remain as fiction. 

I would be team Jacob, but his character started to suck too as far as being abusive and stuff as well, so now I‚Äôm basically team Bella ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",
1fib7el,What‚Äôs your most cringe-worthy Twilight moment?,lnl8ayd,2024-09-17 16:05:20,"Hey, fellow Texan! Wait...are you now mansplaining to me, then?

JK I don't want to start a fight. I think it is interesting that we have different perspectives on this. But the majority of the culture around me doesn't lump Texas in with the ""South"" as far as southern culture goes. In fact, most of them would be mildly offended by that. Again, not talking about geography. 

Culturally speaking, there seem to be some pretty big differences, in a general sense. You and I both know Texas is huge and has several distinct regions with their own distinct cultures. But none of those distinct cultures seem to be rooted in the hierarchy of Southern gentry and most come from more self-made men and women who forged ahead into the wild frontier. Again, generally speaking. Linguistically there are differences, too. No Texas accent I have heard (West-East show the biggest difference in our state, I feel like, having family on both sides) has ever sounded like the traditionally imagined ""Southern accent"". I feel like that doesn't start until we get farther east than Arkansas and Louisiana.

1fib7el,What‚Äôs your most cringe-worthy Twilight moment?,lnmtzer,2024-09-17 21:06:11,"Yeah he improves to some degree, but he continues to have a lot of issues with Jacob and is usually pretty vocal about them when clearly Bella has made the choice to keep him in her life. Near the end of Eclipse he purposely spills the beans about the engagement against Bella‚Äôs wishes and knowing that Jacob will not take it well, all during a very critical time. He acts so mature about some things, and then very immature about others.

And growing and changing is a good thing, but just acting the way he did in the first place is still a red flag. It‚Äôs not an entirely normal and appropriate attitude to have for even a second. Plenty of people would NEVER behave like that. And Edward may be more accepting of Jacob as time goes on, but he remains controlling and such until at least when he realizes Renesmee is not evil.",

Not only were the main characters really negative and unlikable, but the first-person narration continually tried to *tell* us that Bella and Edward were certain types of people while the actual descriptions of them *showed* us something quite different. It‚Äôs one thing for characters to be flawed and to possess some unsavory qualities, but it‚Äôs another thing for the story to be told in a way that either does not acknowledge or completely contradicts the existence of these flaws (and thereby not actually treating obvious character flaws as such). 

Bella‚Äôs *supposed* good heart, maturity, and depth that surpassed her peers were amongst the most contradictory aspects of the books. I actually found her to be consistently portrayed as a mean-spirited, disdainful, unnecessarily judgmental, immature, and shallow person. The amount of value she placed on physical appearance was really extreme, and not wearing makeup didn‚Äôt stop her from harping on the importance of vampire beauty and how having that beauty, herself, would finally make her feel worthy of being with Edward. 

Most of Bella‚Äôs thoughts and feelings regarding Edward were rooted in how he looked, so when she told Jacob in *Eclipse* that she would have preferred it if Edward *wasn‚Äôt* beautiful, it came off as nothing more than lip-service‚Ä¶not to mention that the reasoning she gave for this preference was because his appearance made their relationship ‚Äúunequal‚Äù according to her, which only further displayed the unhealthy value she placed on something so superficial.",

I don‚Äôt even think you can chalk this up to Edward being biased, because Stephenie Meyer writes in scenes that we don‚Äôt see in Twilight to justify Edward thinking that Bella is this good and selfless person. 

Twilight‚Äôs Bella is super catty from the beginning; her first impression of Eric is that he has bad skin, she‚Äôs constantly negative towards Jessica and Lauren, etc. She doesn‚Äôt seem to like anyone at her school except for the Cullens. Midnight Sun‚Äôs Bella however, is portrayed as someone who never has a negative thing to say about anyone and goes out of her way to be nice to people. For example, there is a scene where Bella invites a stoner girl to be part of her project group with Mike because no one else wanted her and she would have failed the project otherwise. Edward sees this and thinks that Bella is a truly good person for this because she knew that the girl wouldn‚Äôt contribute much to the project but invited her anyway.

All discussions we have about its racism, vanity, disturbing behavior and toxic relationships are extremely necessary for analyzing the work, but there‚Äôs nothing we can do about the story itself. Thankfully, I hardly ever see Twilight apologists, most people seem to be very much aware of its problems and don‚Äôt read because they take it seriously, mostly for fun and nostalgia. We can take that and start applying for the content we consume nowadays and in the future - IMO, Colleen Hoover's books are ten times worse than Twilight in the matter of relationships, and Harry Potter books shouldn‚Äôt be adapted at this point anymore due to its very bizarre racists stereotypes.",

16rszot,Twilight is such a vain story,k265hpl,2023-09-25 18:21:35,"In order for my brain to make sense of the plot holes I have to wonder if that first day was just partially describing the characters for the reader to visualize and also maybe Bella being depressed or slightly cynical about moving to a new school/ forks, she is a teenager after all üòÜ. The books also show two different peoples perspectives and people are kinda multifaceted so maybe Bella is a mixture of those traits, obviously Edward couldn't read her thoughts so he wouldn't see the way she thinks about other people and so it made her seem more perfect and same with Bella thinking he's perfect because she was also just attracted to him subconsciously as prey. Perhaps SM through Bella is an unreliable narrator too? It's possible she did do those good things as well and failed to mention them because she felt it was irrelevant to her story, but for Edward's it wasn't? I know I'm probably jumping through hoops for this connection here but I also really hate inconsistency and plot holes üòÖ it's been a few months since I read twilight and midnight sun but I did try reading them together and comparing each chapter to make sure it lined up because I was just curious, but I only got through a few of the chapters.",Imokayhowareyou1
16rszot,Twilight is such a vain story,k26fxan,2023-09-25 19:22:07,"Agreed. Twilight‚Äôs Bella was described as being either apathetic or negative toward any non-Cullen at school (and I‚Äôm including Angela in this). Midnight Sun‚Äôs Bella was a completely different character. It didn‚Äôt feel like we were getting more insight into Bella through Edward‚Äôs eyes, but rather it felt like we were being told Edward‚Äôs assumptions about her‚Ä¶assumptions that were in direct opposition to what was actually shown throughout four books in Bella‚Äôs own head. 

And the difference between Bella‚Äôs first impression of Eric and her first impression of Mike is pretty interesting. She perceived Eric as geeky and overly-helpful after describing his physical appearance in a negative way. She had a nearly identical interaction with Mike, but her first thought about Mike - after describing him as attractive - was that he was the nicest person she met that day.

I really hope you learn to stop caring too much about your scars. As I‚Äôve gotten older I‚Äôve realized that flaws are relative.

When I was younger I had perfect skin and when I got one pimple in a blue moon, I would obsess over it. Later I had acne for a few years and now the one pimple seemed like nothing. But the truth is that I wasn‚Äôt happy with beautiful skin nor skin with acne.    
At the same time I don‚Äôt want to minimize the trauma of acne. It‚Äôs quite painful. I just wanted you to know that you‚Äôre young and beautiful and you should enjoy it despite the little flaws. When you get older, you will shake your head that you didn‚Äôt see your own beauty.",Bbgun371

I think the way the books describe vanity could lead one to believe that they have no vanity because they're just like Bella, who is indeed very vain in her actions but is described as having little to no vanity. It's fine if you're an adult reading the saga because you probably know better, but as a preteen, I think it can solidify the shallowness that makes us all so dissatisfied with ourselves when we could instead recognize those feelings for what they are and confront them. My complaint is about the lack of *honesty* and *self awareness*. Any reading material deserves to be criticized, especially if it is aimed at the young and impressionable.",theCursedDinkleberg

Its primary purpose, generally-speaking, is to entertain first and foremost. When it *does* explore societal themes and deeper concepts (for example: The Brothers Karamazov), it STILL is not intended to be a guidebook/role model in teaching good behavior for real life.

She and Edward weren‚Äôt even together for a full year before they got married, and before that he and his family deserted her for 6-7months. The self-insert,plot armor is glaring. Plus she didn‚Äôt want to be a vampire vampire- she wanted to be a cullen vampire, not fully understanding that they exercise great restraint most of the time and they cheat the system to living lavishly. They‚Äôre all still monsters one in the same honey. 

What would‚Äôve been an interesting storyline was for Bella to be bitten at the very beginning of the series right before she‚Äôs set to move to Forks and deemed a rebellious runaway by the police and her mother. (She literally lives in Southern vampire wars territory, no ? Isn‚Äôt Phoenix, Arizona close to Maria and the others like her?) if she was destined to be a vampire it would make sense for her blood to attract attention down south. She then spends those 2 years she would‚Äôve been in Forks, fighting (a future bonding moment for her and Jasper) before she flees from destruction. She eventually ends up in Forks for whatever reason and accidentally kills her father, causing Mayhem. It becomes a high-profile case because she‚Äôs never learned how to dispose of a body and hide their secret and the Volturi catches wind of this. If a story like this exists please let me know. If not maybe I‚Äôll start writing it lol.",

I‚Äôm saying as an artist, I would never use that date in my work if I didn‚Äôt mean something by it cause it‚Äôs such a recognizable date. If it‚Äôs used in art, I assume it means something. Like if SM wanted Bella to become a vamp on her 19th bday and subtracted the number of turning days and got 9/11, there‚Äôs no way she wouldn‚Äôt have recognized the significance of that date.

1kjyxki,Twilight canon you ignore,mrt8hht,2025-05-11 21:14:46,"Two big ones for me that come from the lore guide, but are contradicted in the books themselves. 

1. Vampires being incapable of meaningful personality change. 

The lore guide suggests they carry over prevalent traits from their human days, and they become exacerbated. They're also apparently largely permanent - their personalities are frozen as well as their appearance.

Except... Half the characters in the books show meaningful change, or are implied to have at some point in their history. The only character that Smeyer really commits to this with is Rosalie - and she comes across as one-sided caricature as a result.

Humans don't have a single dominant trait. So it doesn't make sense that vampires then would either. I like the idea of them not being able to mentally develop, and remain somewhat similar in nature. But there's no good reason they shouldn't be able to change with time and events. 

2. Vampires cannot form bonds that aren't driven my mateship or ambition/mutual interest. 

Lore guide says that vampires only bond with mates, don't form traditional friendships or family bonds, and are usually only able to co-exist if driven by a shared ambition (E.g power). The Cullens are apparently an exception, and are the only ones who can feel familial bonds, due to their diet. 

BUT again I think this is contradicted. Same guide clearly states Benjamin loves Amun like a father. Siobhan loves Maggie like a daughter. Breaking Dawn is full of cross-coven friendships. Sure, most large covens formed out of ambition or have a degree of ""transaction"" about them. And it makes sense they'd be largely solitary. But it doesn't go as hard as the guide suggests in the story. 

In both cases, I like the idea of them to an extent - but not as hard and fast ""rules"". They don't really make sense otherwise.",IDinnaeKen

PoC (and everyone else) would still fully keep their ethnicity, they'd just be more pale/muted/ashy/washed out, with a cooler undertone. Not snow white. 

Oh and while we are at it, while scars/tattoos/birthmarks would fade, they wouldn't disappear fully, but remain silvery (for scars) and like a bit of a shadowy imprint.

2. How literally not one person seemed to point out that Jasper nearly attacking Bella was mainly the fault of Edward. Edward constantly bringing Bella around him knowing that she‚Äôs his singer means Edward‚Äôs bloodlust towards Bella is an emotion that Jasper‚Äôs gonna feel as well. And considering he‚Äôs the newest to the lifestyle, none of them should‚Äôve been encouraging Bella to hang out in the one place Jasper can be himself and not have to worry about blood. Instead, Edward was always bringing her over when they were there and just telling to keep his distance like he‚Äôs still not gonna feel all their bloodlust at once.

3. I know it gouges a huge hole in the plot, but I truly ignore the fact that Bella and Edward are supposedly soulmates or mates in any sense. They display traits that are way more indicative of infatuation and curiosity rather than soulmates. I just feel like if they were truly mates, the thought of losing Bella, even to old age, would motivate Edward to change her. I refuse to believe his beliefs and self loathing are so strong that it overrides someone he claims he wants forever with. Also the fact that he even left to begin with while knowing Victoria and Laurent were still out there as a potential threat against his so-called mate. He was able to leave her completely defenseless based on some notion that he didn‚Äôt think Laurent was a threat and he was a good enough tracker to chase Victoria when even James couldn‚Äôt catch her üôÑ it was just stupid. Their relationship should‚Äôve been a high school crush/first love story that naturally ended when he left and she‚Äôd moved on. 

4. Also, in my head, Bella made Edward grovel before just blindly taking him back when he returned in New Moon. With the level of depression she slipped into, you‚Äôd think she‚Äôd have at least some trust issues that weren‚Äôt just about him finding someone better. Instead, any issues she showed were abandonment issues, which doesn‚Äôt really show in the following books. She just takes him back and forgives him and the family 100%.",heyyyitsalli

Sure, maybe they don't age and so they always process things at roughly the level they would have based on where their brain and personality development were when they were turned, and it can be harder for them to change a mindset or something like that, but Carlisle himself seems like a contradiction to that very belief about vampires because *he* and *his* mindset were able to change so drastically from when he turned. He was a 23 year old seventeenth century priest who believed vampires were demon spawn of hell and that being turned took away his soul that wound up befriending many covens with wildly differing beliefs and lifestyles, was presumably in a couple decades long homoerotic relationship of some kind with the *leader* of the vampire world, and comes to a point where he decides to make other (already dying) people into vampires as well. And Stephanie expects us to believe there was no mental changing/maturing involved in that process? Pfft, come on.

Vampire hair can be glued back, I mean, if it's torn out with the skin? Even without the skin. But since it was in the army of the newborns, no one wanted to bother or they didn't know.

In addition, I think this is canon anyway. There was something about adding poison, the body parts will grow back faster, but I think if you don't add poison, but just attach, it will still grow back, albeit slower, but without scars.



I'm also annoyed by the canon problems with the speed, where they are sometimes fast, sometimes slow when the plot needs it. The chase after James and the return to Forks sucks.



Alice and Jasper were supposed to hear James's voice! What the hell?! This is not TVD, where vampires in the show can turn their hearing on and off (which is also complete nonsense). It seems that Meyer slightly rewrote the scene Edward's version, like Alice was in a vision at that moment and so on. This does not cancel out Jasper, who was nearby, and vampires can hear for several miles. And also, in other visions, Alice never became blind or deaf. Yes, she was focused on the visions, but she perceived the surrounding reality and acted if necessary. Otherwise, she could not fight, argue with Edward and so on.



Should Life and Death be considered canon? I still haven't read it, but I know that there was a moment where Meyer tried to make the Volturi Girl Power? Some nonsense that Aro and Caius' wives immediately learned about Didyme's death, and for some reason chose her, planned or killed their mate's and after that they live quite well and rule together with Marcus. This is the stupidest fanfic. For a vampire to kill his mate and after that he is fine. Especially since Marcus is still alive there, despite the fact that his mate is still dead. Which means he is still being forced to live. Or all three of them are forcing themselves. For what? Marcus didn't want power that much, Sulpicius and Athenador... I don't remember, little was written about them. I find it hard to believe that they will live normally after killing their halves. This fucking destroys the whole concept of vampire love. That their love does not change and they cannot fall out of love. And that their grief from loss will be just as eternal and unchanging. Here, the Volturi wives are much worse than Aro and Caius, because they did not kill them. I would rather believe that some vampire with the gift of manipulation or imperio controls all three of them like puppets.",HopeNarnia

But then you have imprinting, which restricts two people from making their own choices. The imprinter is forced into feeling an immediate, permanent connection to an individual, and the imprinted will ultimately align their life with that person because they cannot resist that level of emotional devotion (as seen through Sam and Emily‚Äôs relationship, which I think is what all imprint relationships will ultimately become because Meyers fully intended for it to be a romantic soul mate bond - not a ‚Äúwe will be what they need us to be‚Äù bond).

Early Civil War, they legitimately thought they would win in a few months, so he would have thought the same.  By the end, there were desertions in droves as men just left and went home to their families; plenty were tracked down and killed over it, too.  So even if he realized then that it was wrong, he probably would have stuck with it for a chance to live over near-certain death if he deserted.  They could easily have sent a brother or cousin to either persuade him to return, or hand him in for desertion to be executed; that was common enough.

But he wasn't in for long enough for it to matter; he got turned.  Then he was in that vampire army for a few decades, realized it was wrong, and gained a conscience over eating people.  Then he wandered for a while in a severe depression over eating people, met Alice, then they found the Cullens, and *then* he could really sit down and unpack his baggage properly.

In terms of scars/birthmarks, these are more secondary in the matter to me too as they make a bit more sense (at least they make a little more sense than full on loss of melanin, though even that feels like milder whitewashing). Scars I can see make more sense (as that is well, just the restructuring of the collagen), as with tattoos (as that would be removal of the ink from the dermal cells and maybe venom recognises it as not part of the body), though birthmarks, moles and freckles mean again removal of melanin.

But overall its again a taste thing. Like imagine seeing a vampire thousands of years old with tribal tattoos from the times they were human. The tribe is long gone, civilization forgotten, but a shadow of the tattoos remain. Or maybe proud warrior vampires joking over their human battle scars. Maybe there is a vampire known for their looks who had a specific birthmark under their eye that just makes it all complete. Or maybe Emmett still would have faint scars from the bear attack. He would not shut up about these and he would love to show them to everyone he meets I fear.

I don't think merely having these beliefs is an inherent reflection of how kind or compassionate you are as a person, I think people with such beliefs are only truly unforgivable if they are faced with the reality of how harmful their beliefs are, and yet absolutely refuse to ever change for the better.

Regardless of original ethnicity, a vampire's skin will be exceptionally pale. The hue varies slightly, with darker-skinned humans having a barely discernible olive tone to their vampire skin, but the light shade remains the same. All forms of skin pigmentation - freckles, moles, birthmarks, age marks, scars, and tattoos - disappear during the transformation.*""

1kjyxki,Twilight canon you ignore,mrud4t4,2025-05-12 01:25:32,"That‚Äôs one way to think of it. Personally, I prefer to go with the drafting explanation because of the following. 

The *vast* majority of confederate troops strongly believed in the ‚Äúright‚Äù to own slaves, and were willing to fight for it. However, there was dissent regarding the war (though, keep in mind, many dissenters also either approved of or were neutral regarding slavery): some people correctly identified it as a rich man‚Äôs conflict, others didn‚Äôt  want to be traitors or correctly predicted that things wouldn‚Äôt go well for the South if they tried this (even if they‚Äôd won, the South still would‚Äôve gotten fucked over - over reliance on a few cash crops to keep your economy afloat literally never works out well in the long run).

Unfortunately for those dissenters, a draft was instituted, and attempts at dodging it or fighting for the Union wouldn‚Äôt exactly down well with the neighbors. Therefore, while most of the Confederate army wanted to be there (at least, in the beginning of the war) there was a pretty-insignificant-but-still-technically-there number of soldiers who got dragged in unwillingly. 

IMO, it would make more sense for Jasper to have been one of these unwilling draftees (and therefore already critical of the Confederates), and then, as you mentioned, for him to have fully reckoned with the idea that slavery, racism, and the ideals of the Confederacy were wrong as he got older.",Desperate_Plastic_37

 I know the general agreement is that he's the hottest in bd but I prefer Eclipse him üòÉ. Also the alice thing is actually real, in the movies we dont know too much but in the books it's obvious Alice enables Edward sometimes she's actually pretty ""toxic"" and dangerous,  (I still love Alice she my queen) but Smeyer's writing doesn't sound like Alice is being a good friend.

 I would argue Rosalie sounds the most same/ normal to the audience even though Edward describes her as vain. Also it's so evident that if Rosalie ever knew or was written properly she would have never let Edward stalk Bella or go into her home. That's why I really like fanfic rewrite where Bella and Rosalie are friends ,

 I still love Alice, but she's like ""female Edward "". It's weird to say but she treats (initially) Bella more like a pet/curiosity rather than a full fledged human being. (Its part due to smeyer writing, but from an universe perspective it reads differently)",hisoka_kt

Cause I'm sorry maybe it's my self preservation and wanting to look out for people o care about, but Bella was not worth all that trouble to be honest. Like why am I or the people I care about potentially getting hurt or killed for some teenage horny human who wants to throw away her life and become a vampire for a piece of icicle meat? Bella was not thinking shit through and needed someone to really sit her down and tell her the real shit. 

I also saw a post somewhere where they said something along the lines of ""Bella's chose was all an illusion cause she was doomed as soon as she got involved with Edward"". Which I agree with cause as soon as she really got involved they would of had to turn her eventually or potentially die trying to keep her human. I hate how Edward tried to hold off on turning her cause I feel like it was to late. After that whole James situation Bella should of been turned cause I could of done without all that shit that happened in the other books/movies. 

Carlisle isn't a good coven leader, he lets Edward and Alice run the coven cause they have the most useful powers. And while I do understand the importance of Edward and Alice, I also think that Carlisle still should of put his foot down with a lot of shit. And since Carlisle was with the volturi for 100 years then he should of known how they get down about the laws. Like if I'm a coven leader and I know how the volturi is then I'm not gonna potentially fuck up my safety and the safety of my coven for a human. Cause in canon the volturi is known to wipe out covens and even villages just to prove points and to collect vampires with powers. So it's like why put everyone at risk for a human that one member is trying to keep human.",No_Procedure_4035

I think it was incredibly unfair to judge them, given the circumstances.

Rosalie was desperate for a baby to mother for a long, long time. When Nessie showed up, Rosalie was ready to mother the shit out of her the second that critter was conceived.

Meanwhile Bella went through an incredibly traumatic pregnancy - she literally *died* during it, and then she came back in apex predator mode - and then Edward had to sit there and helplessly watch her go through it all. Both of them were in a bad place when Nessie showed up, and it made perfect sense that they weren't able to transition into parenting mode right away.

So it actually makes perfect sense for Rosalie to mother the new baby so everyone can adjust. If Rosalie wasn't there, Esme would have likely stepped up more, but Bella and Edward just weren't up for the task at that moment, especially considering this wasn't a regular baby. Rosalie was honestly the best choice in the entire family to be taking care of Nessie.

Once Bella was *past* the worst of it all, she and Edward became the parents they would have been if not for the trauma surrounding everything. They were a little awkward but well meaning, protective and actively tried to do right by her, and that's what was most important. That to me just makes them inexperienced, young parents, but not bad parents.",JustAsICanBeSoCruel

As a parent now, I honestly feel a bit bad for Bella because she misses those first few days after Renesmee‚Äôs birth where every one would have been figuring out their rolls and routines, and then there‚Äôs the added element of not being 100% certain that Bella won‚Äôt harm her with her newborn craze. I cannot imagine being a new mom and having everyone over my shoulder or already feeling like they know their place with my child more than me!! It would be really hard. I think overall (though I‚Äôm sure someone will correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) this sentiment of Bella and Edward being bad parents comes not from the things they do but from the lack of things they do, and I wish we had more scenes in the book and movie of the three of them being a family!",handwritinganalyst

And he holds her in his arms all the way back, kissing her forehead. Bella tries to keep her heart from enjoying it too much because she knows it will kill her when he leaves again. 

And when Bella wakes up in Forks after that whole ordeal, and Edward is still with her in her bed, she thinks that she's dreaming. It actually breaks my heart. 

Bella had just spent the past six months being reckless in order to summon the hallucination of Edward yelling at her - it's literally all she had left of him. She knew it wasn't healthy. Bella was balancing on a knife edge of sanity, trying to give her heart what it needed while holding onto reality, mostly for Charlie's sake. 

And and the end of this whole ordeal, when she wakes up with Edward there and still thinks that she's dreaming/hallucinating him, it's the worst torture of all. Give into happiness/delusion and give up her sanity, or reject the dream and all the love that she feels in order to ""wake up"" into horrible bleak reality. 

My heart literally breaks for her when I read this scene. The strength it takes to navigate that moment emotionally, to feel all her feelings and rebalance herself, it's astonishing. And Bella uses that strength to take control of the situation, demand an answer from the Cullens about whether they will accept her, as an immortal, into their family, allow Edward to have his freak-out but remain unbending. It's truly beautiful. 

In my mind, it is THE MOMENT. It is when Bella becomes great. She then goes on in Eclipse to stand up for herself in a new way. She finds her way through between E and J conflict. She follows her emotions, even when they seem to be contrary to common sense. She believes in herself.",dunemi

She moves back to Forks and immediately starts acting closed off. Then she gets with Edward and when the stuff happens with James not only does she break his heart that night as she shreds him to pieces emotionally, cutting deep into his past and character, but then she disappears, gets beat up needing hospitalization, and he barely gets an explanation. 

When Edward leaves, Bella shuts down completely. She‚Äôs depressed for months, doesn‚Äôt talk, barely eats, and Charlie‚Äôs just trying to hold everything together. Then she suddenly wants to run off to Italy? That‚Äôs not normal teen heartbreak behavior. 

Later, she gets ‚Äúsick‚Äù and then somehow magically better, but looking totally different. Her skin, her eyes, everything changes. She still won‚Äôt give him a real answer. Then surprise! she has a baby out of nowhere and just acts like it‚Äôs fine that she almost died? Charlie‚Äôs just supposed to roll with that?

She keeps him at arm‚Äôs length the whole time, even though he‚Äôs there for her through all of it. Honestly, he got stuck worrying constantly while Bella did whatever she wanted, changed her whole life, and barely let him in. I'm not saying Bella didn't have her reasons, but he went through it and deserved way more credit and a break. 

Not to mention all the danger he was in from proximity and relation to Bella. Sure, steps were taken to protect him but nothing is ever certain and he was for sure put in harms way many times. 

Oh and being suddenly thrust into the supernatural world at the end would be hard on anyone, mentally. Unlike Bella, he wasn't curious other than being concerned for her safety.",Sparkle_Storm_2778

for one, it has perfect pacing whereas i found twilight to be pretty jarring in places with regard to the nomads. and as a screenwriter i find new moon to be a perfect adaptation of a book to film. i also prefer the overall warmer tone in new moon but that‚Äôs a personal thing, i like that soundtrack more with the killers, thom yorke, the first muse x twilight track, the camera work is also more interesting in new moon (ex. the breakup scene in the woods) 
the imagery in twilight is really good though especially in regards to the meadow but overall feels random bc why would edward have a long conversation with bella in the pouring rain?? overall twilight kinda feels like it‚Äôs trying to be a thriller rather than the love story it actually is

In the book, Bella is described first flying into the glass and then the collision between Edward and Jasper happens. The order of events was:

2. Edward shouts ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù and automatically acts to get Bella as far away from Jasper as possible.

1gjckkx,a twilight headcanon you 100% believe? ,lvgo1d3,2024-11-05 03:04:44,"I 100% believe that ""singers"" are humans that have the potential to be incredibly strong/gifted vampires, with a more fragrant singer correlating to having stronger gifts. I think singers have some gift that may even subtly express itself during their human life, like Bella's shield. Slightly comparable to imprinting, which is said to be for the purpose of creating stronger wolves/the best genetic match. Someone with strong gifts would make a stronger vampire; their singer scent is meant to increase their odds of attracting a vampire and being turned (if the vampire can control themself enough, of course). 

Additionally, I believe innate gifts are ""bred"" in and a genetic combination of the parents, just like everything else. We see this with both Bella and Renez. Bella is a combination of her father, who seems to be a ""weak"" shield himself, and her mother, who is almost able to project her thoughts onto other people (from Edward's description of her in MS). Hence, you get Bella, who can shield her mind AND project it outwards. Renez is a combination/inversion of both Edward and Bella. Bella can keep people out, but no one can keep Renez out. Edward can read thoughts, and Renez can show people her thoughts.

Bella and Jake become a couple. They married and had a baby. They lived happily... until Jacob imprinted. And as much as he fought to be a good husband to Bella, he couldn't overcome his nature. 

So it was a messy divorce. Bella became a vampire by other means (I dont remember how), and she meets Edward as a vampire. He's devastated. They fight over past events. But they rekindle their love, and it's stronger than ever. 

Bella and Edward watch Bella's daughter, Grace, get married, live happily, gorw old, and die. Grace didn't have any children. She explicitly told her mother and Edward she didn't want to be a vampire. 

Once Grace died, Bella was devastated. She didn't move for weeks. It was Esme that had to talk her into getting up and moving forward for Edward. So she finally fed and moved on.

1cvqrg1,What's something you expected/wanted to happen in twilight but never did?,l4tt158,2024-05-20 03:20:51,"I‚Äôve always wanted to see a scene where Charlie suspects Edward of abusing Bella, especially after the who James debacle. Now I love Edward and am on his team all day, but from Charlie‚Äôs perspective in that situation, especially as a small town cop who‚Äôs probably seen quite a few domestic violence disputes, he would be suspicious. 

From his view, Bella introduced Edward very quickly but she tries to usher him out like she doesn‚Äôt want Charlie to see him, which is normal but connects with the rest. She seems to like him a lot but comes home screaming about how she hates Forks and needs to leave immediately without any true reason. She lashes out and hurts him emotionally and leaves. Suddenly a few of the Cullens are gone too and the rest leave after a week as well. He doesn‚Äôt hear from Renee immediately about Bella being home. The next thing he knows, Bella is in the hospital for a shattered leg, broken ribs, a cracked skull, major blood loss, and the Cullens are the ones who found her? Edward sits by her bed religiously waiting for her to wake up, like he feels he has to. Like he feels awful for what happened.

Then in New Moon, she gets depressed way more than she (logically and realistically) had a right to be. She is eighteen years old and was dating a guy she met a year ago for like‚Ä¶ four months. BUT‚Ä¶ abuse victims can experience very different emotional responses because they are dependent/reliant/ have something akin to Stockholm syndrome to their abuser where the abandonment will devastate them. And then she leaves with Edward‚Äôs sister for a weekend and suddenly Bella is back with Edward and he is depressed and mopey, almost like he is guilty. 

I don‚Äôt know man, I feel like as a cop, Charlie would have seen some of the signs and been worried. Perhaps Bella would have put him to rights and made it clear that Edward would never hurt her (she omits the ‚Äòlike that‚Äô part) and if he did, his family would set him straight and would NOT stand behind him. 

I feel like it would have added to the dysfunctional nature of Edward and Bella‚Äôs relationship, especially when viewed from an outside observer. Again, I‚Äôm pro Edward but I think it would have added a layer of complexity to the relationship. Plus it would have made Charlie seem even more competent as a cop.",Kittykatkillua

Honestly, Rosalie‚Äôs whole personality staying is something I wanted/expected to happen but ended up being ungodly butchered. I know they couldn‚Äôt show much of her dialogue or interactions with Bella that happened in the books because it would eat up time, so I understand, but it still makes me mad. Most of the characters were more or less well represented in the films in terms of how they were written in the books, but there was SO much to Rose (most of which comes through in the form of dialogue or interactions with Bella, as aforementioned) that we never got. Movie Rose just comes across as slightly angry and a little annoyed with Bella because she‚Äôs throwing away her chance at life which is all Rose wanted, and while this is obviously true, again, there was so so so much more to Rosalie in the books. One example; a big part of why Rose didn‚Äôt like Bella was due to her vanity and how upset she was that Edward loved and wanted Bella but never her, and that wasn‚Äôt even touched on at all in the movies.

She was just so different. Book Rose wasn‚Äôt just a little teeny bit irritated, she was genuinely a gigantic colossal bitch basically the entire time and I hated her so much but loved her so much at the same time, whereas in the movies she was just, well, there‚Ä¶being a little teeny bit irritated. Like I didn‚Äôt feel one way or the other about movie Rose and honestly couldn‚Äôt really care less about her because they gave the poor girl nothinggg, but apart from Alice I think she is probably my second favorite character in the books. We and her deserved so much better for the movies and I will never forgive the people who worked on them for ruining her character!!!",Reader_sl-t

It felt very special for some reason.


""Funny how a deadline made it harder to think about leaving, or having her leave. I was glad Seth'd brought that up, so I knew they were staying here. It would be intolerable, wondering if they were about to go, to take away one or two or three of four days. My four days. Also funny how, even knowing it was almost over, the hold she had on me only got harder to break. Almost like it was related to her expanding belly--as if by getting bigger, she was gaining gravitational force. For a minute I tried to look at her from a distance, to seperate myself from the pull. I knew it wasn't my imagination that my need for her was stronger than ever. Why was that? Because she was dying? Or knowing that even if she didn't, still--best case scenario--she'd be changing into something else I didn't understand? She ran her finger across my cheekbone, and my skin was wet where she touched it.""

Think about it, poking Alice Cullen in the chest with a stick is only going to break the stick, pulling Esme out in the sun will only make her sparkle, (if indeed you could physically make her move if she didn‚Äôt want to) squirting Edward with Holy Water will only make him wet and showing a crucifix to Emmett or any of the others will likely only result in confused looks. These Vampires are fast, beautiful, extremely strong and pretty much bullet proof. They‚Äôre intelligent, educated, kind (for the most part) and would kick the arse of just about any other Hollywood vampire I can think of yet I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd need to take my shoes off to count the number of fight scenes in the whole story.

He thought it was amazing she can block powers and encouraged the Cullens to change her as there was likely more to her gift if she became a vampire. He would have had Bella or Edward (or both) kill if she didn't have that skill in the hall, as Edward attacked them to protect Bella, which was an illegal thing to do.


I can't quote him but it was along the lines as no vampire has ever seen a gift like hers.¬†Some of the other vampire gifts have been repeated or similar.¬†


It honestly reminds me of the mutans from Marvel, how there were different classes of abilities. It seems Alice, Edward, Alec, Dakota Fanning's character, the amazonian, and the element guy were all the highest level of skill.¬†


Whereas Dimitri, the Canadian shocker, Jasper, Renesmee, were more common level of skills vampires would get.¬†


It wasn't Alice vision of the fight that made him leave in the books. It was the acknowledgement that Bella made his special attack force useless. Which meant it would be a rebellion militia against the Voultiri. They realized going to war with them over Renesmee (who wasn't illegal after all) would be end of the Voultiri eventually. Either that day or another.


¬†So he is hoping with hundreds of years from now, he will either get Alice or Bella, but mainly Bella now. Alice would serve as a personal radar to know of incoming trouble. Bella would render any special vampire useless. Alice foresaw that wouldn't happen and the Voultiri never bothered them again.¬†",Beautiful_Resolve_63

Now to be clear, there was a good chance the Volturi would still win that fight. They had a lot of well trained fighters as opposed to the hodge podge group the Cullens had.

I think I get what they were trying to convey, it‚Äôs just a bit much for me, lol.

I was surrounded by a looot of biased reactions to the movie(s) while they were being released though, despite avoiding actually watching them myself. I had sort of defended the ‚Äúsparkly‚Äù bit as surely not being that bad or over the top based off of the promotional stuff I‚Äôd seen. I was really rooting for more subtlety.

Agree about the age though. Pattinson is almost a year older than me, and at 21/22 I was first starting to notice actual differences between myself and teenagers. It was believable enough, especially earlier on like you mention. But unfortunately, actors aren‚Äôt immortal. I suspect casting a 16-18 year old came with possibly more risks of unexpected and uncontrollable real life physical changes, though. At least Bella was human, so Stewart had a little more leeway to naturally mature and still fit the character.",elvenfaery_

Bella has an unheard of ability to control her newborn urges, which they've established by the time she's around Charlie.

Bella doesn't choose Jacob because she never at any point loves Jacob romantically. She considers that she COULD if given time, but never considers him over Edward. She always loves him platonically.

Esme is biologically older, at 26, while Edward is 17 forever. That should be sibling age, really, but eh that‚Äôs how the Cullens work. 
Also, movie dramatics. The books have actually a little more chill, but film adaptations have to make things big and dramatic, or people might find a lot of conversational scenes uninteresting.

But the actors are just human, so there‚Äôs no way to ‚Äútransform‚Äù bella without makeup.  

Edward is older than Esme. She‚Äôs not his biological mom lol. She lost her child when she was human, that‚Äôs how Carlisle found her, bc she attempted suicide and jumped off a cliff. She was 26 when it happened. Carlisle was 23. Edward was 17, Alice was 19, Rosalie was 18 I think. I‚Äôm not sure about the others. Esme wasn‚Äôt always his ‚Äúmom,‚Äù when Rosalie was joined the family, Edward was supposed to be her younger brother. But Esme always had a motherly vibe about her, and that was the dynamic that developed over time. Same thing with Carlise as the paternal figure since he is their creator. 

Bella didn‚Äôt choose Jacob bc she was in love with Edward, not Jacob. He was more a friend when she needed him but Edward always had her heart. 

This all makes more sense when you read the books. But I agree with you that the acting was awkward, especially in the first two movies, and especially with Bella and Edward. Bella is supposed to be awkward and quirky, but she‚Äôs also funny and sarcastic. In the movies she‚Äôs only portrayed as painfully awkward and serious. Edward is also funny sometimes, I like their banter, but he‚Äôs also meant to be really intense and that‚Äôs also the only part you see of him in the movies.

In the movie we don't have Bella's internal monologue so a lot of it can be seen as her possibly denying her feelings outwardly. Either way, she is fairly manipulative of Jacob. She wants him around for mental support and multiple times she says things that could reasonably be interpreted as her being romantically interested even though she maintains that she only wants him as a friend.

But upon reflection I imagine it would actually be odd for Jasper (and maybe Alice) to view Carlisle as their father because of the lack of age gap and also the fact that Jasper was not created by Carlisle and had already lived a vampire life before him? Whereas Edward Rosalie and Emmett all looked to Carlisle to lead them in their vampire life so the parent bond seems more natural there. Anyway, just thinking out loud now. I agree, siblings would have made way more sense!!",handwritinganalyst

As for the overprotectiveness, i personally dont mind but i get how its annoying, if you ever get there Midnight Sun makes it a little better since we see his side of thinking.

The bad decisions unfortunately is a plot device that is still used to drive drama forward, for me the books would be much better removing some of it and adding more romance moments (like the clearing) or more backstory.",Yurthia

Please, please make sure you also read Midnight Sun! A lot about Edward and his behavior is explained in there given you are now in his head.",Writers-Block-5566
1jfzujb,First time Twilight reader crashing out,mixx0th,2025-03-21 08:28:59,"I want to start this off by saying that I really don‚Äôt like Edward or Jacob and think Bella would be way better off being single or being with someone else. But if I had to pick between the two, I lean towards Edward. I‚Äôm also going to try not to spoil stuff for you as much as possible. 

The thing is that Jacob and Edward both undergo a lot of character development in Eclipse, with Jacob getting worse and Edward getting better. Like about halfway through Eclipse, they kind of flip almost? It‚Äôs weird, and I don‚Äôt know how to explain it in a way that doesn‚Äôt spoil stuff. Plus, we find out some lore about the wolves in Eclipse that makes Edward a better choice in my opinion. Knowing Bella, I don‚Äôt think she could be completely happy in a relationship with Jacob (like she would always have some anxiety/worry) after knowing this information. 

And from what I remember, Bella stays this way in all the books. She‚Äôs just very much a teenager, and that can cause her to be a bit annoying at times in terms of the decisions she makes and how she doesn‚Äôt think of the consequences. But I do like how she knows what she wants and just goes for it, mainly because I like seeing female main characters be that determined about what they want in life. Not that I always agree with it (most of the time I don‚Äôt); I just like seeing women be determined like that. What bugs me the most is her low self-esteem though. I don‚Äôt blame her for that (it‚Äôs a very teenager thing, and she‚Äôs surrounded by supernaturally beautiful people), but I wish we saw her gain some self-esteem through the books. Like I wish New Moon focused more on her finding herself and being more confident, instead of her just being depressed and relying on someone else to help her.",muaddict071537

Just have to get into the head of myself at 14 to enjoy the drama of the relationships I think. 

I agree on new moon. I think a lot of my frustration was coming from Bella‚Äôs lack of ability to just live for herself.

1jfzujb,First time Twilight reader crashing out,mjb4snu,2025-03-23 13:46:22,"I agree with a lot you wrote.

I just wanted to put my perspective on that depression part.
Depression itself - and I'm talking about in RL for a moment - is very tragic sickness and often people that don't suffer from it can't understand.
My husband and I both suffer from those, he way more than me and in a self destroying way.
So much that I had to take the kids and leave, because he was taking us down with him and I couldn't help.
He is getting better now and slowly able to be a loving father.
Thanks to therapy.

Another aspect of Bella is the hurt from being left, losing the love of her life ( from an 18 year old perspective).
I also know that feeling, the hole in the chest, the tears, the screaming at night - I have been there years before twilight was even written.

So coming back to a fantasy romantic novel. Where everything is often more tragic than in reality.
So no, I don't blame her for not getting over it in just 6 months, I get that refusing therapy ( because what should she tell the therapist?!), and relying on other people. Well actually just Jake, by coincidence first.
If you want a strong, independent, feminist Bella - there is a lot of potential in BD ( even though I think it could have been written better), but twilight and new moon Bella are just not the right personality for that.",CSilver80

She could have stayed with this friendship between them, making Jake, even though he has a crush on Bella, accept her boundaries.

I love sooo much the moment when Bella considers her feelings first like siblings love.

There would still be reasons for Bella not wanting to leave Jake behind, Edward freaking out because she is going to la push... It's still possible.

So in my head, and in the fanfiction I once started writing ( but never finished) they are just the very, very best friends.

And that would have made it so much easier, even the imprinting.
Imprinting on your best friends daughter is ( still a bit cringe) way better than on the daughter of your former love crush, that you even kissed!!
And showing that Jake is able for platonic love would have helped me accept the concept of being whatever the imprinted one needs ( especially as a kid).

If you want to give updates only once or twice per book, I'd say make new posts; comparatively few people would see an edit to an existing post compared to a new one. But if you want to give much more frequent updates, edits might be more reasonable. You can also make notes as you go and then post all at once showing what you thought at various points in the book.

Do you read other books in this genre? Fantasy or paranormal romance, either YA or new adult / adult? 

I ask because I read twilight when it first came out and it was relatively one of the first of its kind. It kicked off the paranormal teen romance genre. 

But I would love to know what it would be like to read twilight for the first time having already been reading this genre for a decade. Like, are you expecting certain things or tropes to happen because they‚Äôve become so common. 

I personally always acknowledge in my reading that there are many books that I probably would have liked more if I had read them first. Like after you‚Äôve read 10 books about the fae, it‚Äôs hard to be surprised anymore. 

When I was growing up and reading in the aughts, I burned out on dragons. I remember hating Eragon because I had already read that story so many times and liked how other books about dragons featured their dragons.  

Either way I‚Äôm excited for you. Twilight is still one of my favorite books of all time (just the first one) because I think it was just done so well for the genre. I‚Äôm also canonically the same age as book Bella which is fun.

A working knowledge of what good is, and what evil is. The nice thing about the apple is it has so many symbolic roots. You‚Äôve got the apple in Snow White, one bite and you‚Äôre frozen forever in a state of not-quite-death‚Ä¶ Then you have Paris and the golden apple in Greek mythology‚Äîlook how much trouble *that* started.

But as someone who identifies a lot with Bella and who is very shy, socially awkward and introverted as well, it would have killed me inside to be Bella in that situation. Like, Edward just makes it ten times more awkward by saying she already ate. 

What really frustrates me about it is: Whenever I picture myself in Bellas situation, I always imagine myself playing out this situation beforehand in my head and thinking exactly what I am gonna say. You know, as a socially awkward person, that's what I often do and that's what I could see Bella doing. Just going through what she's going to say to be as much of a social butterfly as you can. 

And then, after playing out in your head how the situation is going to play out, what you are gonna say to appear as gracefully as possible, her fucking boyfriend Edward destroys everything by going off script and being like ""Oh no she already ate.""

1jx332y,I read twilight for the first time. The lore‚Ä¶,mmtr6sp,2025-04-13 01:17:53,"I would 100% invest in the Illustrated guide if you love the backstories. They are chock full of information and super fun because there are a dozen vampires with backgrounds and lore to learn about. My favorites: 

*  Aro had also been keeping tabs on them and was hoping to wait for them to grow up more, but the burning on the stake forced him to act earlier then he wanted to. Hence why they're the youngest vampires we see. Jane and Alec displayed psychic powers as humans. In the village it was painfully obvious that when good things happened to the twins then good luck was bestowed, but when bad things happened then bad things happened to the person who did it. They were sentenced to burn for witchcraft where Aro swooped in and saved them just in time. Jane wanted the people who hurt her to feel the pain that she'd felt, but Alec wanted it to go away. This developed into their gifts ( pain and numbing ).
* Aro turned his younger sister in hopes of her developing a strong gift like he had. Didyme. His sister developed a happiness induction gift-basically the ability to make people around her happy/euphoric. She mated with Marcus and eventually they wanted to break away from the Volturi and go off on their own, but Aro wanted to keep Marcus at his side so he killed his sister. He didn't anticipate Marcus' reaction to her death. 
* Sasha ( The Denali Sisters creator ) created each girl because of their resemblance to one another. Originally she created Tanya as she was a distant relative of hers and she was curious about creating a companion. Then she created Kate who had been a body guard for a high born woman and had fought her/Tanya when they broke into the carriage they traveled into impressing Sasha enough to have her transform Kate. Then Irina lastly as she'd resembled them greatly.",Lovely_One0325

Be fair, I was a very late boomers and ""didn't read books"" until 6th grade. So....I was still in my little kid chapter book phase. No way was I picking something like Warriors up at a kid. I need my parents to read Junee B Jones to me because it was too much and too hard.

The movies will give you the general plot line. They don't change around order of anything. They just leave out the details and maybe some important but minor scenes in the books. But she wrote hefty hefty hefty chonky chonkers so...a lot had to get left on the cutting room floor. They completely left Jacob's POV on the floor for Breaking Drawn...which...okay fine fair. Its following Bella so made more sense continuity wise from a movie standpoint. Personally, I'm okay that they did that. I wasn't too interested in Jacob's POV and I didn't like the sudden change because she set me up with a single POV, I'd rather she stayed in a single POV. But I think she just didn't want to write through the time period of gesticulation and having to write the pregnancy experience from Bella's POV. IDK why...maybe it was a publisher thing saying nah you can't tell young readers that But I would have been so in to it as a young reader, NGL. Like they never tell you in school when people give birth, they have a second birth because they push out the sac. I thought babies came out with the sac...NOPE. So...you know...doesn't hurt to educate kids on what pregnancy actually entails after the sperm meets the eggs and then boom, magical baby appears.",BloodyWritingBunny

1kjntfs,Why is Twilight movie cgi so bad??,mrplcxb,2025-05-11 06:28:23,"It was a budget thing. That‚Äôs very low.

To copy and paste from a prior comment I made:

====

Personally I feel like, sometimes, big-budget movies don't always allocate resources intelligently. So even if a movie has a higher budget than the last installment, the CGI department doesn't seem to be the one getting that large cash injection. \[...\] Also keep in mind Avatar (the James Cameron version) had just come out and it was pushing the bounds of CGI but not everyone got a James Cameron Budget to pull off good CGI. \[...\]

Side note, the budgets were fairly low until the Breaking Dawn parts IMO:

* ‚Å†Twilight (2008): $37 million
* New Moon (2009): $50 million
* Eclipse (2010): $68 million
* Breaking Dawn ‚Äì Part 1 (2011): $110 million
* Breaking Dawn ‚Äì Part 2 (2012): $120 million

whereas things like Pirates of the Caribbean series and Avatar have budgets had:

* Avatar (2009): $237 million
* ‚Å†Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003): $140 million
* ‚Å†Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006): $225 million
* ‚Å†Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007): $300 million
* ‚Å†Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011): $379 million (most expensive)

Though on critical analysis of the budget jumps between New Moon and Eclipse, it wasn't all that high. And if you look at how little the wolves were shown in New Moon compared to their bumped up presence in Eclipse that was predominantly in wolf form, it probably wasn't high enough to CGI everything. CGIing all the individual hairs and shit, NIGHTMARE. That's how they do Sully's hair in Monster's Ink (2001: $115 million), hand-drawn each hair individually. \[...\] Which is why its so expensive. Why didn't they have Jon Snow interact with his Dire wolf too. So expensive. They're also multiplying the number of wolves and have multiple in multiple scenes. And wolves, like Sully, ARE ALL FREAKING HAIR. You have fight scenes with vampires that also need a little CGI too. That's a lot for a budget that small to handle, honestly looking at the budget differences

===

They really didn‚Äôt have the money. All that has to be cut up and go to other places, including the salaries of people we don‚Äôt see on screen.

Even their final movie, very low budget. Like Pirates started off with their ending budget. An unknown entity with no following like there was for Twilight as a franchise. You can see how much stock and good faith interest Hollywood put into these two different franchises and the difference in how they treated things targeted at young girls and women.

Like if we look at Divergent that came out two years after Breaking Dawn their starting budget was 85 million. No doubt Hollywood was willing to bet on the book franchise thing now that Harry Potter and Twilight had taken off.

Just take a look at the Harry Potter movies, which did and still does have a larger following and interest but again...BUDGETING seriously is SUPER SMALL in comparison to what was actually going on in the industry at the time

* **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone** (2001) ‚Äì $125 million
* **Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets** (2002) ‚Äì $100 million
* **Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban** (2004) ‚Äì $130 million
* **Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire** (2005) ‚Äì $150 million
* **Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix** (2007) ‚Äì $150 million
* **Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince** (2009) ‚Äì $250 million
* **Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1** (2010) ‚Äì $125 million

At the heart of it, was the focus around Bella's growing romantic feelings for Jacob, while she was trying to cope with Edward leaving her, was very well done. 

I am on ""Team Jacob"". I wanted him the Bella to be together. Like Jacob once said, she wouldn't have had to change to be with him. Being with him would be as easy as breathing. She loved Jacob, even though it took her awhile to finally admit it to him, and to herself. 

But even Edward knew she loved Jacob. She just loved Edward more, and as long as Edward existed, she was going to be with him. She definitely would have had a happy and loving life with Jacob though - if Edward weren't around.

The other thing about **NEW MOON** that I loved, is that is was the real full unveiling of the Werewolves storyline - which was a very entertaining storyline on all levels.

Also loved the scene where the vampire Laurent runs into Bella in the woods...

Dealing with being the adult in the relationship with her mother and not getting to see her dad often. She moved right into cooking a lot for her dad when she arrived. She was used to that and she focused a lot on her studies having few friends. I can't hate Bella for the few immature things she does.

Bella is a bookworm, so it makes sense she has a bigger vocabulary, and from a narrative perspective, it's probably better than the alternative. What if Bella's thoughts were more ""dumbed down"" to that of a typical teenager? We would have tons of lines like, ""He looked like an angel, he was so shiny, I was so in love with him.""

- Benjamin, Kate and Felix are all more powerful than Edward and Jasper 

- Zafrina, Demetri and Emmett are probably more powerful than all the others in B 

- Aro is the master of Alec, Jane, Felix etc. and therefore deserves to be in A at least

- Marcus and Caius have no powerful skills, so maybe C for them 

- James had a tracking ability but it was a rather weak one so maybe C for him as well 

- Leah is not as powerful as Sam , placing her above Paul makes no sense to me either 

- Riley and Bree have no remarkable skills and are newborns, while technically physically powerful, all the others in C outrank them anyway 

- Alice deserves to be ranked way higher. Sure it‚Äôs not an offensive gift but she could definitely use it in many ways to make her infinitely more powerful. Maybe put Alice, Kate, Zafrina, Benjamin, Felix, Demetri and Aro into a new tier above A 

I agree with everything else. This is also just my opinion so feel free to disagree! I‚Äôd really enjoy discussing all the gifts in the comments anyway lol",ancientandbroken

1e2ivsg,Twilight Powerscalling Tierlist 1,ld2t0xd,2024-07-14 01:55:34,"Yeah my tierlist got confusing, the right way to read it, is that the person that comes first is always the strongest and the previous one is weaker, I will have to do it again because this way is too confusing.

Point 1: I agree

Point 2: zafrina yes, that's why I put her at the top of the tier.

Demetri may not be able to beat Victoria once they are going H2H, her gift of self preservation always gives her the right attack, dodge and defense moves to perform flawlessly in battle, I had read a passage from her battle with Edward and it was written that Victoria somehow was evading all of Edward's punches perfectly and moving the right way, only once she gave up on her gift and went for rage, Ed was able to get her.

Emmet is strong, but he is overconfident, young for a vampire and doesn't have much experience like the others here, I remember reading Caius was a military leader, and he trained a lot of the Volturi guard, Marcus is very old thus must be experienced, the romanian bros the same, Jacob and Sam are bigger and stronger than the other wolves, they are smart as well, and seeing as Jacob was able to kill Santiago ( One of Aro's executioners stated to have above average strenght)by himself, when running with Renesmee, I think he and Sam have the edge over Emmet

Point 3: I don't think Aro can contend with them in a fight.

Point 4: Well they are elders, and I think Caius has military background, so I disagree.

Point 5: James can kill most below him easily, not only because of his ability, but because he's stronger than average and is more experienced in killing his own kind, as it is explained in the Guide, I think B is good for him.

Point 6: Fair enough, I had the impression Leah was stronger than the other boys because she appeared to be more ruthless, I agree.

Point 7: Agree.

Point 8: Her gift isn't useful in the middle of a fight, she's a small girl, and weak for vampire standard.

Wasn't Leah regarded as one of the strongest of the Pack in Breaking Dawn? It seems she used all her rage of getting rejected into training and being a wolf, seh doesn't play around too much unlike the other boys, could be wrong. I f she isn't regarded as such, I might move her below Jared and Paul who are more experienced.",Potential_Rule4212
1e2ivsg,Twilight Powerscalling Tierlist 1,ld2gqwu,2024-07-14 00:22:34,"honestly I feel like they don't have enough faith in Renee in breaking dawn when they decide not to tell her. Of Bella's two parents, I could see Renee actually being pretty well suited to being a vampire compared to Charlie. Charlie has Sue and Billy and his job and his community. He has *roots*. I think if Bella offered him the choice to become a vampire he would turn it down for these reasons. Renee on the other hand had no problem leaving behind the life she'd been living for almost 20 years to follow her new husband around the country playing baseball. It was just as easy for her to leave Charlie as soon as she knew she wanted something different. She's erratic and harebrained and she loves to experiment with wild unappetizing food. She jumps around from hobby to hobby and Bella has to actively steer her away from the dangerous ones. I think Bella takes after her in that they both seem to form very shallow relationships with most people besides their romantic partner and direct family. 

If Bella offered vampirism to Renee I think she would accept it, especially if something had happened to Phil. Bella is the only other person she's really connected to so why wouldn't she? She could keep trying crazy new hobbies forever and all the dangerous ones would be on the table. Honestly I wonder if she and Bella would have a better relationship as vampires. Bella would never have to feel worried about her mother if she was indestructible. Plus her power would be fucking terrifying. Bella got so much more powerful as a vampire. If she's that strong as a human, Renee might be capable of full on mind control as a vamp üòÖ I would also love to see it.",bluegirlrosee

Her mouth should have been bruised constantly for all the kissing and don‚Äôt even get me started on how her pelvis should have been obliterated.

I've had this running line the entire time I've read the series and discussed it with other people but they are not vampires they are like the Le Dame Sans Merci or any other variation of fairy-kind in myths and folklore that describes a supernaturally beautiful creature that only exists at night or in dreams and can herald death. A lot of those creatures are described as drinking blood or killing victims or taking a specific liking to a specific person. They don't actually need to be vampires. They don't have fangs, they don't die in sunlight, they don't sleep in coffins, etc. Genuinely if they just called them fairies instead of vampires there wouldn't be any change needed at all.",LeSilverKitsune
1knffki,"What would you change about the Cullens to make them more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù vampires? If anything, of course!",msja92j,2025-05-15 23:14:45,"I would make them have retractable fangs that inject venom through them like snakes! They could control their vemon release and choose to transform their victim if they want to when they feed. I would allow them the self-control/body physics to stop drinking blood when their stomachs fill. In line with that thought, I would make them have their internal organs, but still have their bodily fluids be ""venom-based."" I would have them still be able to go to the bathroom, but only once every six months to a year, and it's just a urine-type fluid. Also, I would let the Twilight vampires cry the ""venom-based fluid"" so they can have that relief/catharsis. I like their diamond sparkly skin, but true to the book where it appears they are on fire when they're in sunlight. I would, however, have the sunlight weaken them to just-above human level, and allow them to sleep for about 3-5 hours each day (natural sleep pattern) or night (if they flip their sleep schedule like a human working graveyard) and they could push through the need for sleep if they have drank lots of blood. I would make them slightly less powerful in that humans could cut their body parts off with diamond blades or something. I think that would make the story a little more believable if humans have a chance to fight back.

Also, I would like it if they felt more of an effect from the types of human or animal they ate; like for example, a junkie human would taste disgusting and maybe make them feel sick, a drunkard would make them feel drunk, someone hopped up on energy drinks would make them hyper, and also an unhealthy person (maybe high blood sugar?) might make them feel sluggish and sleepy. For the veggie vamps, animals that had been exposed to radiation or eaten lots of plastic would taste bad, and maybe the radioactive ones would make the Twi Vamps sick and vomit. Healthy animals would taste better and make them decently strong/fufilled, compared to sick/junkie humans.

2. I agree with the other commentor who said the effect should be as described in the books. They don‚Äôt just sparkle and it‚Äôs so bright it looks like they‚Äôre bursting into flames.

3. No, I think that‚Äôs cool for more magic centered systems but Smeyer was going more scientific with hers (even if the science she invented makes no sense) and needing an invitation wouldn‚Äôt make sense imo.

4. Maybe the mirror could have a different effect which caused the vampires to avoid them but I don‚Äôt think they shouldn‚Äôt appear at all.

Personally I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd change anything superficial about the vampires. That‚Äôs what makes them rather unique IMO.

But I think I‚Äôd like to see her delve deeper into what it means to live so long and unchanging. What it feels like to have ‚Äútime move while you‚Äôre at a standstill‚Äù. Watch friends and loved ones die while you live. 

She does that a bit with Rosalie‚Äôs character but because she‚Äôs a side character there‚Äôs not that much explored. But of the vampire genre, I really like those themes. 

I find it quite sad they can‚Äôt really remember their human lives. 

I also don‚Äôt like the idea, as purported on this subreddit, that they don‚Äôt care about humans too. 

I quite like that struggle to maintain one‚Äôs humanity and the dark monster within. Which is another theme I wish were brought out a bit more. It‚Äôs implied due to the thirst but never being satiated.

In this way, I think because we‚Äôre reading from Bella‚Äôs standpoint, it messages to us she doesn‚Äôt really grasp why Edward and by extension his family see themselves as damned. and I suppose in this way it‚Äôs a weakness of character for Bella that she just cannot understand or perhaps doesn‚Äôt care to understand the darkness there.",BloodyWritingBunny

Another problem I always had with the venom thing is that Stephenie is inconsistent with it. For example, the scene where Bella asks Edward to try food and he takes a bite of her pizza or something.

Besides, I don't think there are many vampires, maybe a couple thousand. And everyone has enough food for now. With farms, to keep track of everything, you will need more vampires, and there will be less food one way or another. And problems with the authorities will be inevitable. I think Chelsea should have limits on how many vampires she can bind to the Volturi.

And in general, this requires a radical restructuring of the world, why do you think the Volturi, and many others, will like this. More order, structure, etc. will be needed. Vampires are more freedom-loving predators by nature, singles, couples at best. Three, four are already too many.

Before the Volturi came, there were already some kind of mini-farms, where vampires declared themselves deities and demanded constant sacrifices. And there were constant wars for territories and simply because of quarrels between vampires. The human of this world owe their prosperity and development to the Volturi.

I also think the Volturi's power isn't all that absolute. They in charge now, they've cleaned up the mess. There are very few vampires left who are older than them, who remember the old days. And they've only set one law that must be followed. If they push harder, there will be more dissatisfied, more desperate. They can be taken down if a dozen vampires start creating a bunch of newborn armies and sending them after them, and sooner or later someone gifted enough to take down Alec will be found.

We never saw them just setting a vampire on fire without dismemberment first. The closest that we got was when Jane threw the vampire baby on the fire pit, but it was a baby, I wonder how it would be with a full-grown vampire. 

I always thought that just setting them on fire wouldn't be an easy thing to do since they have super speed, so they can just run to the closest source of water.

Aro‚Äôs whole point is that humans have the tools and if you have 7 billion humans with those tools that‚Äôs deadly for vampires.
