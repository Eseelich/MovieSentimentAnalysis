piratesofthecaribbean,1k17vep,What was the real point of the cannibal island sequence in Dead Man's Chest?,mnjxap6,2025-04-17 08:43:29,"Jack's initial solution upon hearing from Bill that Jones is seeking him is to set course to land. Of course, his (moral) compass knows that it's wrong to run away from your problems instead of facing them, so it directs The Black Pearl to, in Jack's own terms, ""any land"". Which happened to be the cannibal island. The scene is to emphasize that Jack can't run away from his problem, the compass punishes Jack by guiding him to other dangers for not facing his problem. But the scene also provides a nice way for Will to regroup with Jack.

Jack is a clever one, but oftentimes he's just incredibly lucky in his escapades.

Also, they already had Jack get the drawing of Jones' key from that fortress in the beginning that was never explained further, so it wouldn't have made much sense to also just show them escaping this island without ever going into detail. You can't just leave everything to imagination to cut movie length (in my opinion that is). 

Third thing: Escape from Jones on land and give the pirates a reason to leave it again (because of cannibals) instead of giving them a chill lonely island.",Ace_Law

piratesofthecaribbean,1k17vep,What was the real point of the cannibal island sequence in Dead Man's Chest?,mnk3tdc,2025-04-17 09:50:58,"More or less stealing from other comments...

1. The story-based reason, to show that nowhere is safe. Jack Sparrow initially believed that he is safe on land as long as he is away from the open sea due to Davy Jones and the Kraken. There is also another hint of the growing threat of Beckett and the EITC, further pointed out by Jack finding a can of spice in the cannibal village, and the previous line, ""The world is shrinking ... Jack must find his place in the New World or perish."" Another story element, I'm guessing, is for the film introduce the idea that there could be a god in human form before we learn about one, aka Tia Dalma/Calypso in P3. Granted, one may argue that the Cannibal Island sequence could theoretically survive being cut, but it is silly to say that it has no purpose at all, when there was purpose shown in the film.
2. Fun is another key factor. While we do like and want rich storytelling, at the end of the day, fun and entertainment is what gets people to go out and buy a movie ticket. And in the case of P1-3, you get all of it in one. P4-5 is debatable, because the flaws are more noticeable there, but even the harshest of critics will say that Gore Verbinski directed this sequence well. While being a great horror director, Verbinski does love his fair share of absurdity, madness, and slapstick.
3. Toy sales is definitely another reason. Cannibal figures, Cannibal King Jack, and even bone cages. Plenty of products that might interest any young adventurer. Though I can't confirm whether or not these toys ever sold well, possibly due to the general audience's perception of the franchise.
4. My guess, based on how it looks, one of many references to Indiana Jones. A main character being chased by natives toward their mode of transportation.

Another reason, a rather boring one, is that P2-3 were in production back-to-back, without a completed story and screenplay to follow. And deadlines. Filming began in February 2005, with Cannibal Island being one of the first sequences in complete development by May 2005, when it was filmed.

Personally, despite its potential redundancy, I'd rather watch Cannibal Island on repeat than most of the nonsense we saw in P5: Dead Men Tell No Tales/Salazar's Revenge, most of which was barely amusing.",CJS-JFan

I disliked cannibal island. It was too silly and cartoony. I feel the same way about the water wheel later on. It's my main grief with DMC and for a good deal the reason I like both CotBP and AWE better. I remember seeing in the theatre, and thinking:

""Shit, they got all that positive feedback about the humour in CotBP, and it made them go overboard and turn this movie into a straight up slapstick comedy.""

I got really worried that this was the end of the PotC I readily loved after Curse. Luckily I was wrong. DMC picked up with a strong narrative and plenty of the great balance of moody/spooky/humour/action/story that hallmarks the original trilogy. But cannibal island? I'd rather have had more backstory on Davy Jones, Beckett, or ""people ain't cargo"", even if that was meant for AWE. Heck.

You can't just leave everything to imagination to cut movie length (in my opinion that is).

Hmm, more or less true, yes. The filmmakers have followed the technique of ""intentional ambiguity"" to only define what is necessary for a story to work in the world-building process, or so I'm told, to introduce ideas and concepts, even characters, and leave them open-ended, to be designed later. In the case of the Turkish Prison scene, it was expanded upon by the video games, which is ironic because they may or may not be considered canon to the overall continuity. Though there are cases where such ambiguity was made to their detriment, such as certain retcons made in later films.

But even the writers have said and I think defended in the commentary why Cannibal Island was worth keeping in the film, partly through reasons which were shown in the film. Jack not being safe on sea or land, showing that the EITC's influence reached even this uncharted island, etc.",CJS-JFan

Had they let Jack go hide in any of the less remote locations, having Will try to find Jack to negotiate for the compass would be pointless, because surely  the EITC would've captured Sparrow easily had he made port in a well populated area.

The more obvious was the character being chased by natives to their mode of transportation, whether it is Indiana Jones running to the plane or Jack to the Black Pearl. One that is a bit more of a stretch is Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, which had a native tribe beating on drums, placing firewood under someone's suspended body before attempting to light the wood with a torch, and the suspended character trying to blowing at the flames in a desperate effort to put them out.

Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio wrote P1-4, while Jeff Nathanson wrote P5. Supposedly, the ones responsible for the flashback scene in Salazar's Revenge was directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg. But yes, it is generally agreed that P5 was poorly executed in more ways than one.

Who may be more to blame is Disney, because they could hire someone to oversee and manage the entirely of Pirates universe, and coordinate the films with the other ancillary works.

Barbossa needed to be kept alive until the end of the agreement.

The risk of Salazar killing Barbossa after killing Sparrow was likely considered, hence Barbossa working with Jack to find the trident in order to do away with Salazar.

You began by saying that there was no guarantee that Salazar would be interested in making a deal with Barbossa. There is also no guarantee that Salazar won't find him. Between the two options, making the deal with Salazar is a much more viable option because there is no way Salazar would turn down the offer to secure his revenge against Sparrow. If I'm recalling this correctly, Salazar began taking out his fleet one by one and it was only a matter of time until he got to Barbossa. Dude was renowned for clearing the sea of the pirate surge, and evidently he kept doing it even after he was freed from the triangle.",sjk0603

Did the writers forget?",mgbdn5c,2025-03-06 12:03:34,"Salazar had no reason to believe that letting Barbossa lead him to Sparrow was the only way to possibly find Sparrow at some point before Sparrow died of old age (which is ostensibly Salazar‚Äôs only time limit for exacting his revenge since he‚Äôs undead). Nor did he have any reason to trust a pirate to not try turning on him at the first possible opportunity (as Barbossa ultimately did when Salazar stupidly allowed him and his surviving crew to pursue Sparrow onto the island armed and unattended). From Barbossa‚Äôs perspective getting that opportunity (to not die) was entirely contingent on Salazar NOT killing Sparrow before Sparrow made it to land, AND on not deciding to extort someone else into drawing Sparrow out. Saying that Barbossa couldn‚Äôt take the chance of Salazar catching up to him and killing him so his best chance of survival was giving Salazar a gift-wrapped opportunity to kill him is my opinion ridiculous. Why wouldn‚Äôt Barbossa instead seek out Sparrow himself with the compass without Salazar‚Äôs involvement and figure out how to find the trident from there? And if Salazar *did* find him first, he could have always used the negotiation he attempted in the movie as a last resort.",Semblance17

If only I can remember exactly what happened back then upon my first viewings. Like do I remember knowing that I saw Keira Knightley appear with Natalie Portman in Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace? I know I did see Star Wars (in 2005) before POTC (late 2006-ish), even though I was a bit late in the enjoyment of both franchises. Crush-wise, I can never recall for sure who my crush was back then, as there were more than a few worthy of praise. But if we're focusing on just Keira, she's great: hard to believe she was 17 in P1, but she did good. And of course she was gorgeous, from governor's daughter, to ""[pirate](https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Skirmish_off_of_the_Isla_Cruces)"", to Pirate King of the Fourth Brethren Court.",CJS-JFan

On top of that having just an awesome overall story, music, best villain etc.

P2 is arguably the best (dare I say perfect?) sequel, taking everything you know and love about P1, then goes deeper into the lore.

There is the ingenuity of how they were able to shoot both P2-3 simultaneously, back-to-back, and without a completed script. Though I think this affected P3 more because they planned so few scenes ahead, i.e. Barbossa's resurrection and the Tortuga ending scene, among others.

Dead Man's Chest > World's End > Curse of the Black Pearl

Don't get me wrong CotBP is an amazing near flawless adventure movie but I got invested on a whole other level once the storylines with Will's dad, Davy Jones, and Beckett all come into play. Curse of the Black Pearl was a super fun pirate adventure, but once Dead Man's Chest began, that's when it started to feel like an epic, legendary pirate saga as opposed to just a singular campy and comedic hunt for some cursed gold.

He doesn‚Äôt have to postpone any sort of mortal judgement in exchange for servitude, and the implication made throughout the films is that people on the crew have all made a choice to serve Jones.

Jones not only assumes that Will won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt escape, but also that he‚Äôs something of a valuable hostage against Jack‚Äôs end of the bargain. He keeps Will as a ‚Äògood faith payment‚Äô, and just takes him aboard; to keep an eye on him if nothing else. I think if the three days Jones gave Jack had passed and Will was still aboard, he‚Äôd have been mortally wounded and offered the choice to serve in order to be saved from death for a hundred years.

For Jack -> Compass pointed towards Land

For Elizabeth -> Compass pointed towards the heart

The compass points towards what you want most:

1. What Jack needs to stop the Kraken, is to find the heart and threaten Jones

2. What Jack most want is to not die against the Kraken and stay away from the Sea, because he knows the Beastie is hunting him at all times, even when the black spot disappears momentarily, he is still afraid and yearns for survival, therefore, the compass points towards nearest land.

Kind of tricking the trickster, y‚Äôknow? Realizing that they‚Äôre equals turned him on in a big way, which leads to their flirtations later, and ultimately to her leaving him to death by kraken.

Gibbs: Jack! But the Pearl....

Jack: She is only a ship mate.

Gibbs: you're right, into the longboat!

I think it's more believable that this was the moment Jack seized the opportunity to do the right thing because it happened in the same movie, and many people wouldn't remember the quote in DMC delivered by Elizabeth when watching the 3rd movie.

I think evidence points towards Jack having compassion and caring towards his crew and wanting to help or save them, rather that it was just the Pearl he came back for, he was the captain of all of them after all.

Jack thought the whole crew and ship were going down, at the moment, he just rushed back hoping his interference would make a difference against the Kraken, and it did, he shot the powder kegs, then the Kraken made a retreat back into the water before its final move, allowing the crew to escape, he didn't think about him as the main target in the moment.

The roles also inverted at the end of the movie:

- Jack became the good man

- Elizabeth became the traitorous pirate, leaving him behind, that is why Jack calls her ""pirate""

You see, this is where I see a problem. This is how things can through way out of proportions. People are jumping into assumption territory. 

People tend to overlook critics, in my opinion. What people don't realize is that these movies are blockbusters, meant to appeal to the masses as much as possible. People also need to realize that the percentage scores that you see on scoring are a mathematical percentage indication, not an overall assumption that critics tend to hate the same exact things about a particular movie. Critics are critics. That is their job. Their is job isn't to necessarily *hate* ""fun"" movies (as the dissenters on internet lead to believe). No, they have to take into account all the others aspects a film (i.e. writing, characters, music, special effects, casting, voice acting, other visuals, pacing, dialogue etc.). And yeah, it is true that you might come across a review that may sound ridiculous in your eyes, but you also gotta understand that critics are human beings and you can't always take things at face value. 

You see, this is the problem...the bridge gap between audience members and critics are usually very wide. Audiences want to be entertained. Critics want artistic merit. Now, I'm not that this is how things are (in fact, it could be vice versa). People really need to be more opened minded. 

Seriously, why do people care so much about a fucking number being attached to movie? I get the whole hype around the Mario movie and how fans loved it, but critics hated...yada yada whatever! But do you really have to label things as black and white? People were furious that Mario movie got a 59% (last time I checked) on RT. Okay, so yeah? Who cares about an estimated number? I mean, the Mario movie was fine (entertainment wise), but was the story noteworthy? No, it was bad or good, it was just mid. Did I have a good time? Yes. Is that all I care about? Yes.

Pirates one and two had amazing music but Hans Zimmer blew me away with dead man's chest. Second best OST of his next to interstellar IMO.

Don't get me wrong, he looks great, but he also looks VERY fake to me. So do the rest of the crew. I remember when I watched it being surprised to see such a cartoony set of characters. I mean they all look so classic Disney style; something you might see in their theme park rides.

You also mentioned nothing competing in terms of entirely CG characters. But someone else here mentioned it already: District 9. 

To me the prawns are far superior and that was the first movie where I didn't just have a lack of suspension, but I actually was in disbelief that they looked SO REAL.

Dead Man's Chest should be kept in a hall of fame and shown on public television on all channels at least once a year. It so beautifully stays faithful to the craft of cinema, and there is a true magic about the entire affair.

Those blue alien people.

They were... **literally**... no improvement over the gungans in _Episode 1_ from 1999.

This wasn't even subtle, either.  There were many shots where the camera would swap between a closeup of a human actor and a closeup of a blue alien face.  The human actor would have believable head motions and physical movements and such.  All they had to do was try to mimic that.  But nope.  The alien heads are mostly static and share that floaty quality almost all CGI has.  Especially the lips, which move as though they just got back from the dentist and still have a few hours of total face numbness to look forward to.

Why bring up issues with a movie from eight years ago?

Because Groot and Rocket Raccoon share those issues.  Just really bad character animation.

I'd hesitate to call him a villain because he is only malicious out of pure human qualities and not like Beckett, who is driven by desires of business. If you think about it, most of the villains in the *POTC* universe exist because of their human flaws and needs.

Nighy was great at being Jones. I swear every time I watch this movie, there are more animated details to pick out.

It's not because the first movie is somehow more lighthearted that people prefer it; I don't even get where that idea comes from. It's because Curse of the Black Pearl is an absolute paragon of structure and economical storytelling. This tightness is partly a result of the film being originally conceived as a self-contained work, as it means everything gets to be set up and paid off before the credits roll.

Almost every scene is both distinctly memorable and accomplishes many things at once, communicating so much about the characters and setting from so many different angles so elegantly, often wordlessly, that a lot of the time you don't even realize the information you're absorbing until it comes back around later. Perhaps most impressive is that it does all this while maintaining a strong sense of narrative momentum. The jokes consistently land, but the movie also knows when it's earned a moment to let the drama breathe in earnest. It builds and builds on itself to a wonderful supernatural twist midway through which keeps the viewer on their toes and frames everything in a new light, clearing the deck for a climax in which every thread neatly weaves together.

Each character is dynamic and well-realized, even the distant secondary antagonist of Elizabeth's prospective husband who would have been so, so easy to write as a totally generic one-note asshole. Yet in the end when Elizabeth tells him she doesn't want to marry him, he just... respects her wishes. And as primary villain, Barbossa is both properly sinister and sympathetic. His fate is surprisingly bittersweet and places the focus squarely on the figure's humanity. Elizabeth and Will are strong leading characters who display a lot of growth over the story. And Jack stands above them all as a true wildcard; the character is simply magnetic. It isn't random that he instantly launched into pop culture immortality following this first appearance, and I don't think he ever again feels as enigmatic as he does here. 

Curse of the Black Pearl is a perfect example of a *smart* adventure movie that never condescends to its audience but also never loses sight of fun, and it fully deserves to be ranked alongside the all-time greats of its genre.",King_Allant

I think that if something as bold as those two sequels was made today, people's minds would litterally melt, after years of being subjected to the mediocrity of the Marvel standards that has spread and contaminated almost all blockbusters. And the same holds with many professional reviewers who said 'meh' back then but now award 4 or 5 star to each MCU movie.

Another thing you didnt mention, is the steep quality increase of the music. Hans Zimmer and his team rushed something in 2 weeks for the first movie, but the way they expanded it on DMC and especially AWE, truly was mindblowing. The Kraken theme, Davy Jones' theme, the whole new Jack Sparrow suite for the 2nd movie... and the 3rd movie's love theme is the most heartbreakingly beautiful thing he has written to this day. Those 2 movies are just full of musical treasures, with surprisingly few straight rehash of the famous themes from the 1st movie.",-Ds---

Davy Jones has additional animation for all his animal aspects (his tentacles have rules of their own for movement and weight and manipulation of the environment), is shot on a moving ship (already one of the hardest things to shoot in film), and often in conditions that mean pouring rain on the actors (rain can be good for disguising effects for full CGI characters but less so when filming humans in the condition) - in addition to having a skin texture that's slimy and reflective (and constantly moving thanks to those tentacles) and in addition, the character is a tragic one you're meant to feel for - in the old-fashioned romantic sense of it, he's the 'tortured soul' type with watery eyes.

I believe Jackson originally hired Del Toro to do a new take on Middle-Earth, even if it was just aesthetically.  When he left the project, it caused a shit storm as Warner Bros was racing to get the movie into production before they lost the film-rights back to the Tolkein family.

If the VFX team can be supplied with ALL of the proper information from the scene that they are working with, the level of detail and seamless compositing that can be done is spectacular. Even from a relatively small team.

When a gun hoe director isn't taking the time to let the VFX teams gather that information with special tools and equipment, they end up having to approximate thode values in post and ""eyeball it""...leading to tiny and subtle inaccuracies in everything from light levels, character positionings, animations, lense corrections and distortions etc. The list goes on. 

Once those approximations all get stacked together, your brain just knows something is off. It's too many tiny things to know exactly what, but the VFX just don't and never will fit the scene.",Gallamimus

Here's a quote from an interview w Terry Rossio, one of the writers:

> INTERVIEWER: I believe you were specifically involved in writing the supernatural curse of the¬†Black Pearl. Tell me about your experience developing that from the Disneyland ride.

> ROSSIO: One funny moment came during story development, regarding the skeleton pirates in the moonlight. We knew we wanted to have sword-fighting skeletons from the start because those were cool and already part of the ride. But we also wanted to see the actor's faces, you don't want to make Geoffrey Rush into a skeleton for an entire film. So, the natural idea would be to do it like in¬†Ladyhawke, pirates by day, skeletons by night.

> But the producers shook their heads. With all the nighttime fight scenes, CGI was expensive at the time. We couldn't afford for the pirates to be skeletons all night long. I was sitting at the table and laughed out loud. Everyone looked at me. ""What if the pirates are skeletons at night, but only when the moon comes out? Can we get away with that?"" They¬†loved it. ""Yes! When the budget gets tight, we just put a cloud in front of the moon!"" And that's what we did.

The pirates freed Calypso who was trapped in human form by the original Brethren Court in the belief that Calypso would help them against Beckett and Davy Jones. This plan was created by Calypso who brought [Barbossa back from the dead](https://youtu.be/6oHe8lS0Huo?t=42) in the first place to engineer and get the pieces of 8 that bound her to human form in the first place. They are on the fourth Brethren Court by this time in POTC history. However Calypso secretly wanted revenge on the brethren court and planned on [killing them all once](https://youtu.be/511HV5Vb5vI?t=175) freed since she was a Goddess of the sea and can change forms so one form is [torture for her for so long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=511HV5Vb5vI). But then it was revealed Davy Jones who was the man she fell in love with and betrayed by not being there for him when the 10 years of the Dutchman was up and they could reunite was the one who taught and showed the [First Brethren court](https://youtu.be/gwfCO_1pxl0?t=106) how to trap her in the first place so when she was finally freed she was angry at both and became a chaotic neutral type and became that maelstrom they had the final battle in since both sides were both responsible for her entrapment and the pain she suffered being stuck in one form. Which is where I think some people got lost and confused about in the end. 

[From DMC setting it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADtyN0G5G3c). They also specifically [framed](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/b0t63c/detail_in_pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans/) a scene to show the crab music locket box Calypso had that also Davy Jones had one too. You can see it in DMC when Tia Dalma goes into the back to get the Jar of Dirt for Jack Sparrow and he steals a ring next to the [locket](https://youtu.be/D55WWSBwSks?t=32). For Davy Jones starting at [13 seconds](https://youtu.be/L0JbaZtoKAs?t=11) in when he is playing the organ and the same tune planes in DMC and later ATW from both their lockets. The song Davy Jones is playing is a sped up version on the organ.

>Tia Dalma: **You know of Davy Jones, yes? [the Crew nods] A man of the sea. A great Sailor. Until he run afoul of that which vex all men.** [Jack pockets something while no one‚Äôs looking]

>Will: What vexes all men?

>Tia Dalma: [she teasingly touches Will‚Äôs hand] What indeed.

>Gibbs: **The sea?**

>Pintel: Sums.

>Ragetti: The dichotomy of good and evil. [Gibbs and Pintel give him a look]

>Jack: **A woman!**

>Tia Dalma: **A woman. He fell in love.**

>Gibbs: **No no no no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with**.

>Tia Dalma:**Same story, different version and all are true. See it was a woman as changing, and harsh and untamable as the sea. He never stopped loving her. But the pain it caused him was too much to live with. But not enough to cause him to die.**

>Will: What exactly did he put into the chest?

>Tia Dalma: [puts hand upon her breast] Him heart.

>Ragetti: Literally or figuratively?

>Pintel: He couldn‚Äôt live, putting his heart in a chest. Could he?

>Tia Dalma: It was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings. And so, him carved out him heart, lock it down in a chest, and hide the chest from the world. The key he keep with him at all times.

A prime example of how a studio swung big and made bold choices without compromising the craft of the art.,fqshynj,2020-05-16 05:43:00,"Del Toro was working on the script with Jackson & his team.  And given everything Jackson was saying about it at the time, it felt like he was hoping to pass off the reigns & become more passive in his involvement as a writer/producer.  When Guillermo left just months before filming was set to begin, there wasn't really much that Jackson could do to salvage it.  The studio had an immovable deadline that needed to be met, so it was either push through with what they had already or scrap the project all together.  While the critic in me might've preferred the latter, there was just no way to get out of it at that point without eating great financial loss given that they already had contracts in play & people on reserve waiting to start working on the film.  




Not blaming anyone, obviously, be it Guillermo Del Toro, Peter Jackson, or the studio themselves as all were just looking out for their own best interests.  But I think the general public *really* takes for granted just how special the LOTR trilogy was.  It was getting pitched for over 50 years before it ended up getting made.  No one considered it to be filmable.  Even with all of the technical advancements we had made by the late 90s, movie studios were still trepidatious at the idea.  Then, based on the feedback that they had already given to Jackson, he & his team were originally pressured into selling LOTR as one or, **at most**, two movies until they met the people at New Line who said, ""But it's three books?  It should be a trilogy of films.""  The bigwigs understood the marketing implications of releasing 3 movies back-to-back-to-back, and that the greatest payoff from all of this would only come with great patience & even greater effort.  And, even then, it still took them years to develop & prepare before shooting even began after that.  All of that juxtaposed with The Hobbit, a single book, being stretched out into three movies before the clock could strike 12 and they'd lose any future chance of squeezing that particular IP's teat dry.  




Quite simply, one series was a calculated investment.  The other was a quick cash grab.",Kim-Jong_Bundy

Everyone knew about the rights' deadline to start production on another Tolkein project since *Return of the King* was released.  Warner had actually even planned for it, getting Jackson/Del Toro on board to begin developing *The Hobbit* a few years before they legally needed to start production.  Then, during that time, the MGM stuff & a buncha other shit I imagine happened, thus delaying their work further.  And, like you said, eventually Del Toro grew impatient & peaced the fuck outta there.  But by the time he left and WB was finally ready to go at it again, they were left with only like a year to start filming before the rights would revert back to Tolkein's estate.  So, Peter Jackson begrudgingly stepped up and cobbled together what he could by adding and subtracting from another one-of-a-kind creator's ideas.

There's also other challenges, like Ewan McGregor & others literally acting against a green screen. Those can't be fixed sadly.

I always like to take the thought that basically, given the time and money, the director could of fulfilled their vision. Star wars looks great today, and the problems with the prequels isn't limited to dated CGI. It's also to a script that managed to make Oscar winners very wooden.",Hirmetrium

Lucas also founded Industrial Light and Magic, which did the spefial effects of Dead Man's Chest which this thread is about.

""Lazy"" is the last word anybody should use to describe Lucas. He is a tinkerer. He is never satisfied with his work. He is constantly trying to push what can be done beyond what is reasonable for the time. His own films have variously succeeded or floundered because of that drive.

The man built his own film empire. He fought against the studios, the directors guild, etc. Lucas is the reason why we don't sit through 5 to 15 minutes of credits at the *beginning* of movies.

The dude literally fought an uphill battle and revolutionalized almost every aspect of modern filmmaking. He suffered from exhaustion, and his wife left him in part because he was too busy focused on his new film empire.

Yeah, his own movies have dated technology. It's befause he pushed the envelope for experimental and new technology. The first uses of CGI in movies were Lucas. The first digitally filmed movie, Lucas. FOX Australia exists because of Lucas.

The dude literally revolutionized how movies are merchandised. He took a huge gamble on it and everyone thought he was stupid, but he built a multi-billion dollar company out of it. There has literally been SW merchandise in major stores, consistently, for close to 50 years now.

Like Pixar ane fully CGI movies? Give Lucas some credit. Like the mogies that pioneered CGI like Jurassic Park? Give Lufas some credit. Like movies like Dead Man's Chest that still hold up? Give Lucas a little credit.

You can show A New Hope or the prequels to people today who will find them dated, boring, etc. The reason for that is that so many filmmakers were inspired by Lucas that they carried his torch and lit it even brighter. Every envelope that he pushed has been lovingly pushed even further by hundreds of other creative people.",Holmgeir

When the pioneering work gets done, it's because the director and the entire crew are in on the plans. The VFX teams get to do it ""by the book"" so to speak (even if they're writing the book whilst they do it). The end product is usually utterly mind blowing and of a quality not seen before. 

Unfortunately though, as soon as such a technical achievement is made or new VFX ground is broken, all of a sudden hundreds of other studios need to try and deliver the same product or risk losing business. They then undercut each other, fudge and fake their way to try and produce a similar look which is rarely as good. Money talks, so those fudged skills are the ones that survive. 

All this does is dig an ever deeper hole for the industry, making sure other teams rarely get given the time needed to make the art truly shine. The cost and time to get it done properly is usually met with ""well X company did it for half that price, didn't need half this many personnel and didn't need to hold up my shoot schedule to take pictures of shiny balls.""

They built some really nice interior sets of the Air and Space Museum in a freaking ship hanger to fit in all the replica rockets and planes.

RotK was the first fantasy/sci-fi/horror movie ever to win the Oscar for best movie. Not even Kubrik, Hitchcock or Spielberg had managed that before. 

I take this as an indication how it has contributed to the change of our perception of fantastical stories as stuff for children and nerds to something that can have proper artistic merit.

The Lotr movies also incredibly contributed to fantasy/ geek culture finding it's way into the mainstream, basically paving the way for Harry Potter, Marvel, GoT etc. I still remember when Lotr movies came out, suddenly you could see women reading the books everywhere, because now suddenly fantasy either started to appeal more to women or made it socially more acceptable.

You're right in everything you said, which is what makes LOTR one of if not *the* biggest trendsetter of modern cinema.  My point is simply how people are so used to a saga of movies all being made at once like Pirates of the Carribean or Avatar or the Matrix.  They're used to a single franchise consuming the entire zeitgeist for 2 or 3 years like with Marvel's Infinity War & Endgame.  They've seen the big third-act battle scenes.  They expect long-term character development over the course of multiple films as if it were television.  



And yet, there are many who don't realize how much of these expectations are due to the success of LOTR.  And there are even more in positions of great power who don't realize *why* those movies work and their's do not.  And It's because, from the moneybags to the PAs, that entire trilogy was a labor of love

Lmao in America mate, in america. Western Europe is LOTR, China doesn't give a fuck about Star Wars, and everywhere else it's just a film series.


""Look at how many more"" Give the numbers then, you make a statement - back it up. 


You forget that the Lord of the Rings has been around for a substantially longer time, in the form of the books. In terms of most beloved universe of all time, Star wars is far from being considered that especially since the Tolkien Universe  has already been around and cherished by people since the 1950's (that is 70 years, a sizeable legendarium, multiple republications, translation into 38 different languages, and 3 massive films). Harry Potter has more bloody international appeal than Star Wars, and Marvel is slowly creeping in as the current generation's 'Star Wars'.

The reality is that Star Wars has not been good since the 80's, it's just a commercial Juggernaut propped up by Disney. It's extremely popular in the States, but that does not translate world wide - Marvel/LOTR/Harry Potter are currently more popular/beloved.

Come to think of it, the actual most 'beloved' universe is Harry Potter, as it dominated two forms of media, whilst maintaining a high level of artistic merit/quality. Only 3 of the 9 star wars films could be compared in terms of craft to the Harry Potter series, and again those were back in the 80's.",

For example, I think he only finished a first draft of the script for ROTS a few weeks before filming began, which is absurd.

This scene needed Aragorn to do *something*. Every main living character needed their story to crescendo with their biggest challenge. Gandalf - who instilled courage in everyone else for so long couldn't let his falter, he still needed to give people a push; Merry & Pippin not only show they can hold their own, but are second and third into battle; Frodo & Sam have to deal with the most evil thing in the world in it's own fucking house, etc. 

While another medium like a novel may be fine having Aragorn look  to the tower, or the volcano, or deep within himself and remember everything that has lead up to that moment -- on screen you need a visual representation of this. That's why the original draft had toyed with having him duel the apparition of Sauron. We've just seen this guy spend two weeks running across country killing orcs, he slaughtered Uruks at Helm's Deep, he casually won an army of ghosts to help him, he cut his way across Pelennor fields... If he were just to hack away at some other grunts there is quite little tension. Yes, we're cross cutting with Frodo and Sam's biggest challenge, but to then go back and see more-of-the-same with the seemingly invincible Man, Elf and Dwarf hacking more orcs, it lacks any progression of threat. When they realized why fighting Sauron made no sense, they thought ""well, what the hell can we throw at Aragorn?"" and a plausible answer is a Troll. It took the whole Fellowship to kill one troll in #1, so it's established as a formidable threat.  

Is it perfect? No. Does it make sense? Er... Sure.",theBelatedLobster

This would also apply to the other examples that I mentioned like Pirates & Avatar as they were all made afterward, which was kinda my point 



>Harry Potter came out the same year, and was already looking to be 4 films+ long.


I would also credit the HP series in that same vein as being one of those to break the mold & help set the standard for nerdy genre films to become financial juggernauts.  But having multiple titles under one franchise is irrelevant to what I was saying as that's the goal of every potential blockbuster ever made.

Two examples:
- in *At World‚Äôs End* they have an elaborate backstory between Jack, the East India Trading Company, and his refusal to trade people that resulted in his branding. Tell that story! Don‚Äôt leave it as subtext
- *Dead Men Tell No Tales* had Javier freakin Bardem as an awesome sea captain get outmaneuvered and an army crippled by Jack in a flashback! I would have been much more interested in that than the trident of destiny mcguffin thing.

Also, the main characters were great but the whole Pirates trilogy doesn't get enough credit for the writing of the minor characters like Gibbs, Pintel, Cotton, Swann, and the two British soldiers.   All of them were characters with their own minds and different priorities than the mains.

I personally think CoTBP would have been fine on its own no sequels but that's not the Disney way, success = sequel it seems. And they paid off imo. 

But I feel like most people's gripes from my experience are that it's not the cgi, the story, the new characters but Jack Sparrows character development.
In the first movie, he may be a bit flamboyant and like a loose cannon but he always has a plan and/or an ulterior motive. With the whole stealing the interceptor scene for example.
But in 2 and 3 he just becomes more and more ridiculous with things just sort of panning out good for him by chance, it's more luck than planning for example the tribe island in 2 and the God damn world's end crab boat thing in 3. It feels like they went ""okay Johnny do it just like you did first time but.. More"".

You can tell that the writers and director were truly swinging for the fences and even if they missed more often than not, at least they tried. The 4th film in particular just felt lazy all around compared to those two.

Plus the last hour(ish) of At World's End, while over long, is something of a masterpiece in my mind.

I don't mean to rain on the parade here, but they are mediocre movies, at best. Perhaps, and I'd go out on the limb here for it, they are much better when viewed together as you describe. But generally speaking, despite nostalgia, it's hard to say that ""meh"" movies are truly fantastic... 

By comparison - nobody needs to tell you CoBP is fantastic when ___ - it's just a great movie. Tight writing, good acting, good effects, etc. 

The others lean far too heavily on visual effects, kitsch, and an overly complex plot just to tell a story in the same universe... Sorta like... nah, don't need to say it. :)",dart_catcher

The director, Gore Verbinski, started off as a visual effects artists himself, so he really knew exactly what was possible and how best to shoot each effects scene to get the most out of his artists.

On top of that, a lot of the effects were practical, rather than pure CG. This made the films *insanely* expensive, but it's what makes them look so great. For example, the scene where the kraken breaks the merchant ship in half? They built a full-scale model ship, filled a pipe with concrete and dropped it on top. The result is a scene which looks *amazing* because to all intents and purposes what you're seeing is actually happening, they just painted out the pipe and replaced it with tentacles.",DarkNinjaPenguin

Maybe its just because I hated the third film so much but I found *On Stranger Tides* refreshing; the ending scene also concludes Jack's story arch involving his search for immortality.

The first three are solid narratively because of the two leads:  Elizabeth and Will. They both have goals and drive and great character development.

That had it's charms but let's not let nostalgia distract us from the fact that the potholes where brutal. 

When they introduced Tia Dalma in Dead Man's Chest she makes comments about Davy Jones that don't make sense by any standard as if the writers at this point didn't know she would be revealed as Calypso. There is a point where a character isn't written as a good liar but appears in retrospect unaware of its own background. 

In fact everything todo with Calypso makes no sense. She has no impact on the story considering her insane power level. She throws a massive temper tantrum in form of a storm but that's it. It's not targetted and there is no further effect. She's not taking revenge she's just making a fancy swirly for the battle to have stakes. It also seems to have no long term effect on the universe that they fucking released a sea god that supposedly made the waters significantly harder to sail for pirates. Calypso isn't just chaotic evil, she's completely confused chaotic evil. She does things. Because she does them. Because she's the sea *it doesn't have to make sense* (were practically getting beaten over the head with the lampshading for lazy writing). 

And Davy Jones villain motive is that he's kinda got hit over the head too. The first part, sure, makes sense, where he gets supposedly betrayed by his godlover that he sold his soul to (!) so he gets a lot of pirates to work together and imprison her (nevermind for a second we're supposed to brush over the fact that he has no reason to know how to do that). But then, after half an eternity of being screwed over and screwing people over because he's still bound to the vow he made to her (and she crapped over hard) all she needs to do is say ""whelp, ya know, I kinda love you but I'll always be an abusive bitch, which you can't be mad about because you should have known"" for him to go ""yeah, makes sense. I love again, notice me senpai."" I've seen octopus solve complex puzzles, so if anyone wants to blame the tentacle brain for this degree of stupid, I'm calling bs.

Calypso was a plot device they did so badly.

EDIT: And i'm sparing you all a similar rant for the whole jack-will-liz triangle that only exists for pointless sexual tension and lovers quarrel. It's completely nonsensical even by teen drama standards and severely hurts the character consistency of Elizabeth.",Quantentheorie

They were all debating releasing her because they *didn't* know what she was going to do. Some said that she would be grateful. Others said she was still their enemy. Essentially, no agreement was made.  
  
Then Barbossa said 'screw this' and trapped and planned to release Calypso anyway with the intention of ""I'll release her and she'll help me out"". That...*kind of* worked, just not as intended. They did release her but nothing really happened except she caused a storm for the final fight. Hence the 'what now?' from some of the pirates and some replied ""Nothing. It didn't work.""

Nah bro we're gonna fight to the last breath""  which was *also* the point of the storm-for them to fight it out. And then they beat the dutchman and won the fight.

The first movie is about a young naive boy joining up with a smuggler to stop an evil juggernaut with supernatural forces. Smuggler is obsessed with the fastest ship around. They take the ship to do things, implied the smuggler really only cares about money. Boy almost gets the girl (who is essentially a princess) throughout. References to a lineage. Rag tag group take on big evils and the ""empire.""

Second movie Who is my daddy? Meet my Daddy. Get his dagger thing. Also, let's go to a swamp to visit a wise old supernatural being who will tell us about destiny and fate. Boy loses girl to smuggler, smuggler dies...ish in a cliffhanger end...but everyone agrees to go rescue him in the next movie. We mix plots a bit here in that an old bargain by the smuggler is the core issue here, not as much the being chased by the Empire...but both are present. Old smuggling friends brought into the fold (whether Norrington is a Lando substitute is arguable). We also have a weird Ewok crossover here instead of the third movie. So it goes.

Uh oh, big angry Empire is back, let's go get a big coalition of previously unknown but similar anti-Empire folk. Also need to rescue the smuggler. On the way, let's resolve the princess and smuggler romance to get the love triangle out of the way. Big ship battle at the end which seemingly ends the Empire. Boy makes tragic sacrifice (gets the girl sorta...so that's a change), saves father from his supernatural eternal doom. Defeats the bigger grislier evil and becomes the sole weilder of the supernatural power.

I think one of the biggest problems (that each Pirates movie built on) is the development of the three main characters. In Curse, Jack is not the main protagonist. He‚Äôs the sidekick foil to Will. And yes, he does have some goofy moments, but in Curse he‚Äôs much more of a clever, conniving character. Each movie subsequently made him dumber, goofier, and more clearly ‚Äúthe main character‚Äù. Will is the traditional hero of Curse, going through a hero arc and realizing that pirates aren‚Äôt all bad. He‚Äôs stubborn and naive, but also caring and brave. The sequels mostly just have him around for action and the ‚Äúsave Dad vs marry Elizabeth‚Äù choice. Elizabeth gets more of an arc in the sequels, but they don‚Äôt build much on her initial character. She remains stubborn, headstrong, and adventurous, while getting into more and more crazy situations. Honestly, Norrington and Davy Jones have the best character development in the sequels.

And then Elizabeth goes from being Pirate King back to being some kind of prim and proper rich person? That dress she is wearing at the very end of the last movie is ridiculous. The whole ""trident breaks all curses"" shit was also fucking stupid, because they teased Davy Jones and I am so happy the series got cancelled and they couldn't bring him back to ruin his story.

The first three movies are a perfect little trilogy for me, the other movies just aren't canon in my brain.",drflanigan

Pirates 1 motivations are pretty straight forward:

* Jack: Wants the Black Pearl and generally money
* Will: Wants to save Elizabeth
* Norington: Wants to save Elizabeth and marry her
* Barbossa & Crew: Wants the curse lifted

Pirates 2 and 3 motivations get a lot more complex and alliances shift over the course of the films:

* Jack: Wants to get out of his deal with Davy Jones and never die
* Will: Wants to get his dad back from Davy Jones
* Elizabeth: Wants a pardon so they can live happily ever after
* Davy Jones: Just doing his job and pissed at Calypso
* Norington: Wants to get his station back and regain honor
* Gibbs & Crew: Wants to survive and make $
* Bootstrap Bill: Wants to save his son
* Capt Feng: Wants to release Calypso
* Tia Dalma: Wants to be released I guess
* Cutler Beckett: Wants to rule the seas by controlling Davy Jones

Bootstrap Bill gave a frightening tale to Jack that this man has the *Kraken* working for him, of all things. If the Reaper of the seas is coming to collect your soul, he'll be intimidating for sure.

I know with how complicated the MCU is now, they basically made Iron Man's last suit iterations nanotech and much more ""fluid"" so that the CGI would probably be simpler, but I really love going back and seeing how much effort went into the first suit (I'm pretty sure they made an actual model of his suit), and the weight felt pretty believable.

Agreed. 1 is classic, 2 is epic. The scale jumps. The production quality is much better. Now Jack, Will & Liz are small beings in a much bigger, dangerous world with the likes of Lord Beckett and Davy Jones around. It added a danger and edge to the world. The ships look and feel magnificent.

Then those 2, Norrington & Jack go on a hunt for Davy's chest to gain control of it for their own reasons. jack wants to call the kraken off, Will wants to free his father and Norrinton wants to send it to Beckett to gain his status back in the Navy. Elizabeth gets to find her true self more as she is more at ease on ships than in corsets. She is an adventure girl after all. There isn't much overstuffed or technical about this. Part 3 is where that starts.

5 absolutely. 5 is a disgrace to the franchise. Funnily, I think 4 respeced the characters. Jack, Hector and Gibbs were the same as before. It's just that the story for 4 was boring and without the Pearl and most of the earlier crew, it felt a bit empty.

Some movies aren't resolutions in the usual sense, but are a kind of good farewell to the characters, like *Toy Story 3* or *The Last Crusade*, and yet they too get further sequels.

In the first film, all of those characters' subplots all tied into the central plot. While they do in the sequel, as well, that central plot is more a MacGuffin than a story. It's a bunch of independent threads coming together because of the chest, but so much of those threads requires a ton of exposition which makes the film feel overstuffed. The first film was *The Black Pearl* crew's motivation against the motivations of the other parties to save Elizabeth (Will and Norrington) or save their ship (Jack and the other pirates) - since those opposing Barbosa all have a goal that lends to each other, it flows so much more naturally. 

In *Dead Man's Chest*, it's ""I wanna free my Daddy,"" ""I wanna save my fianc√© (even though I'm doubting I want to),"" ""I'm not sure what I want, but I wanna not be killed by the Kraken,"" ""I don't want these fuckers to stab my heart,"" and ""I'm not sure what I want, but, hey, everyone else wants this thing, so I must want it too."" No one really shares any motivations, so it's a juggle. This movie starts the clusterfuck of backstabbing that makes the cup flow over in the third film. It's all engineered drama, where the first excelled at the characters' all sharing a motivation while having different goals - the sequel is different goals *and* different motivations, but driven to claim the same solution.

To me, Pirates 4 felt like a continuation that was at least hinted at after At World's End. I know it's hard for the movie to feel as much like a Pirates movie because the trilogy was wrapped up nicely and ended some important character arcs. It's a good thing they didn't bring them back (looking at you 5), but at the same time I can't deny I'm biased with 4 because I'm a fan of Barbossa.

I know everyone loves Jack Sparrow but I personally loved Hector Barbossa more as a character. He just feels like the most pirate-y pirate out of them all, and in a way Pirates 4 is basically seeing Barbossa go through the same arc Jack did in the first Pirates movie. We don't see him reduced to something weak, instead we see Barbossa conquering his newfound weakness and going for revenge against a notoriously feared pirate. I just loved seeing Barbossa win again, killing Blackbeard and taking the magical sword and ship for his own purposes.",HussyDude14

Matrix, LOTR and Star Wars were finished by then, and Harry Potter's last book came out so most people already knew how that story would play out. 

Today, we have so many franchises and cinematic universes being born and dying every year and I don't think they quite have as novel as an effect as they used to.

It can be tricky to write dialogue for a unique character in the first place, but trying to write dialogue for a unique character that is being portrayed with a defined 'voice' is harder still.

For the first film they just had to think about 'would Jack Sparrow say this?', in the later films it was a question of 'would Depp's Jack Sparrow say this?. Sometimes it works out because stuff ends up feeling more natural, such as with Hemsworth's Thor. Each film got better in terms of his dialogue, but at the start he tried to act in accordance with the writing which didn't really work. They adjusted and it was great.

Depp didn't act to the writing in the first film, he did his own take and it was magic. They adjusted and it sucked.

And I think most of the characters are in on it for the most part, because they're all pirates and Beckett is their common enemy.

I think almost all the jokes land, all the action is exciting, different and serves a purpose, the lore about the Locker and afterlife and the Dutchman was compelling and tied directly into the characters.

The first is just such a perfect blend of dramatic action and tongue-in-cheek nonsense, and all the characters feel unique and play an interesting part in the movie. 

Dead Man's Chest loses a little of the charm as it feels a little too 'sequel-ly'; the action is probably the best of the series but as a result they sacrifice some of the individuality of the characters to make them all swashbuckling badasses (see Elizabeth) but all the Davy Jones stuff is just phenomenal. 

At World's End is probably my least favourite of the three but I don't think it deserves half the hate it gets. I'll say it's slow to get going, it's cheesy as hell at parts, and it introduces way too much lore in a single movie but beyond that everything's pretty awesome. I find the plot itself to be the most interesting and layered of all the films, and the often lamented backstabbing just adds to the fun and twists the narrative in some pretty neat directions. And that final battle is undeniably a sight to behold.

There seems to be a perception the Curse Of The Black Pearl is an A grade blockbuster and the other two are just shameless cash-ins. But while they don't quite match up to it's greatness, the other two are still exceptional action films.",TheOncomingBrows

Nothing they introduced broke any of the story from the previous movies--it instead built up the narrative to the peak it could go two. 

Same goes for the characters, who were still at core the people we met in Curse, but with enough evolution for their decisions to still make sense.Sparrow as a character still had integrity, and this was before he was written into self-parody in the godawful last one.

Lastly, and most importantly, Johnny Depp still cared about the work he was doing with those movies--an aspect that has severely deteriorated since then.",BellyCrawler

Think back to the reveal in *Black Pearl* about the undead curse. It was this huge ""ta-da!"" that completely caused the movie to pivot. What started out as a clever swashbuckling movie with pirates, damsels, and a Royal Navy, suddenly changes into a story about mythical curses, and the undead!

*Dead Man's Chest* opens with things ""back to normal."" With familiar characters of Will & Elizabeth and Port Royal. The plot begins with Will & Elizabeth being blackmailed to find Jack Sparrow. We see pirate bars, and pirates and Royal Navies! And again, the movie pivots with Davy Jones! But he isn't just some pirate! He is a sea monster! And he has THE KRACKEN! The whole mythology just busts open! The Flying Dutchman is now some sort of magical place with even more interesting characters too!

*At World's End* opens up still amid what was happening in *Dead Man's Chest*. If anything, it feels like the same movie, but that isn't a bad thing. We are back in the driver's seat with Will, Elizabeth, Jack, and everybody else. By the end we have gone full circle. We have met tons of cool characters., been introduced to tons of mythos and codes. The story has met it's natural conclusion; boy wins girl, heroic trio saves the day, the main characters have gone through real development and growth, the monster is defeated, and the wily Jack skirts off to have so many unbelievable adventures! (Sea Turtles, mate.)

But the fourth movie, *On Stranger Tides*, we open to just Jack on his own. We dive right into unfamiliar places, with unfamiliar faces. We are given almost no time to care about any plot. The writers banked on people loving Johnny Depp as Jack, and Barbosa & his monkey to be enough ""nostalgia"" for us. And, it just doesn't work. 

Now, what is worse is that Disney knows *Stranger Tides* wasn't well received. But rather than examine why and fix it, they attempt to rehash the same concepts that worked before (Heroic Trio, Evil Monster Captain with a Magic Boat, Some Artifacts, and a Curse), and just hoped we would come back. 

At this point, The Franchise is just that, a franchise. Maybe someone will come along with an interesting tale in that universe. I hope so.

Jack randomly starts asking people to *pay him* for saving him. This is completely new for him. And it's all explained as his back story. That's great for a standalone character, I guess. But for a character *in movie fucking FIVE*?!

Not to mention that it goes against the grain of what Jack was in the first movie. Many people don't know about Jack's past, as set out in the first movie, and almost completely revealed by a deleted scene from the first movie.

Jack Sparrow was a privateer. He decided to sail under the command of The East Empire Trading Company, for none other than Cutler Becket, one of the main antagonists of the first movie.

Jack Sparrow, a law-abiding sailor, was transporting slaves on behalf of Cutler Becket and TEETC but had a change of heart and liberated them.

He liberated a hundred slaves. Remember that number.

For liberating the slaves, he was branded a pirate (quite literally, as seen on his wrist, by Cutler Becket), and his ship The Wicked Wench, was burned and sunk to the bottom of the ocean.

Jack, now branded a pirate, Did Some Stuff‚Ñ¢, and then went to meet with Davy Jones. Davy Jones agreed to resurrect the Wicked Wench from the depths for the price of Jack's soul eternally at the helm of the Flying Dutchman when he was done.

And then Barbosa mutinied and Jack lost the pearl.

This is referenced in a sly way later on, in Dead Man's Chest, when Davy Jones requests 'a hundred souls' in exchange for Jack's freedom from his debt.

And all of this is referenced in a deleted scene with Jack Sparrow and Cutler Beckett talking and Jack says 'People aren't cargo, mate'.

And then.

Movie five.

Nah he was just always a pirate. Got his command by smashing up Salazar. All that crap with the Wicked Wench/Pearl, all of that. Just nah. Throw that all away!

POTC are incredible as a trilogy. But four and five just ruined it by trying to be too quirky and change established backstories.

I love the first three to death. But after that, it went too far. It strayed too much. It tried to add shit to characters that didn't need adding to.

It really is in a league of its own thanks to fantastic storytelling and how well it handled its horror/adventure elements. Dead Man's Chest is quite good, extremely fun and enjoyable (love that cannibal island opening, the Kraken, the three-way sword fight, etc.) and expanded the universe in awesome ways (Davy Jones is imo the best-looking CGI character ever thanks both to creature design and amazing effects), but by the third, the script had grown into a convoluted mess. Having said that, At World's End is still an enjoyable flick, I like all the POTC movies (even 4 and 5 to a lesser degree...though Jack's deterioration as a character is more evident than ever in that last one) but LOVE 1 and hold 2 above 3 4 and 5.

I‚Äôve been a PotC fan since it was announced. I love these movies, and I agree that the first one is a perfect film. 

They lost the original spark chasing the money with the last two (of the trilogy), it felt like to me. The original was so great because it toed the line between reality and fantasy. It wasn‚Äôt bang you over the head with fantasy plot and elements- it was a smattering of fantasy in a swashbuckling character movie. It was a love story and a comedy. It was a historical film and a fantasy movie. It dealt with the dark and with the light. You could believe that the entire plot happened in real life, and no one would have been the wiser. It brought back pirates in a pirate dead market. 

Jack Sparrow was a phenomenal character, as evidenced by his explosion in popularity. Because he was so grey. He was dirty and ruthless, you never fully understood if he was madness or genius, yet in the end he always landed on the side of the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù. He won even if he played dirty. You could root for him even if he did a few bad things. Throughout the rest of the movies after the original one, he slowly turned into a overblown stereotype of himself. They thought CotBP was so successful because of Jack, but it was really the entire movie all together that made it so wonderful. 

4 and 5 it clearly became ‚Äúthe jack sparrow show‚Äù. The original trilogy is great, like you said, and I enjoy watching them every once in a while. But the first one is just fantastic and if they had stopped there I would have been completely satisfied. After the first movie, there are plot holes that don‚Äôt make sense, scenes that are obvious fan service, jokes that fall flat, and plot lines that make you either roll your eyes or wonder if you‚Äôre dreaming.

I never expected the first one to be any good until I saw it on DVD about a year later and realized how good it was, and I saw all of the subsequent films in theaters.

That includes 4 and 5, incidentally, even if those weren't as good. I think it might have been best to keep it at 3... and yet I still found myself buying tickets. 4 was more interesting than I think it gets credit for. It works mostly as a standalone, like the original, and it had some interesting character choices, but it suffered from being adapted from a pre-existing source, and most of the new characters lacked the personality of the ones we'd met in previous films. I felt Blackbeard was good, though, owing largely to Ian McShane's performance.

5, well... I sort of just wanted a night out, really. It was probably slightly more entertaining than 4 overall, but more of the same. If you've seen any previous POTC film, you know almost exactly what to expect from this one. Still, it at least resolved some character arcs.

I keep watching these movies mostly out of habit, and to support pirate films in general. Once a booming genre, it was dead for decades until POTC came along. I'm not sure if there's a way to do it better than what this franchise did, but I'd at least like others to try.",PercyHavok

The next two are OK. I've not seen the last two because they looked like they were trying to get blood from a stone. 

I can't stand the character of Elizabeth Swann. I hate how she put her pirate fantasy/obsession ahead of just about everything else. I hate how she gets turned up to eleven without any real explanation of how she gets from lady who can't breathe in a corset to total badass. Every decision she makes is the ""correct"" one and she never has to make any sacrifices. She gets everything she wants in the end. Will Turner starts off ok but is eventually sucked in to this writing as well.

Everyone goes on about Jack Sparrow and I liked him in the first three, so that's all I'll say about him.  

The character I really liked (and who I think gets overlooked) was Norrington. He's Will's love-rival to Elizabeth and could have been set up as unlikeable as is usually done. Instead he is portrayed as a good, honorable man who is hyper competent and who unselfishly puts everyone else's interests ahead of his own (a trait which ultimately gets him dishonored and killed). He's a foil not only to Jack Sparrow but to Elizabeth Swann in this way.

He actually has a nice character arc where he actually experiences plausible growth and changes. He is an incredibly conflicted character by the second movie and into the third, having fallen from Grace, and while he's never truly able to recapture who he was before, he's also no longer lost in life. He's able to reclaim ownership of his principles and behave honorably, even if his concept of ""honor"" has evolved.

And then they killed him off in probably the stupidest way possible. Yes, it's 2018 and I'm still upset about it. Here's the best swordsman in the cast and he gets one-shotted by a shambling, demented zombie. Here's the only truly ""good guy"" and he doesn't get a happy ending. There was so much more that could have been done with Norrington, especially with how he and Sparrow just *gel*... But he got the stabby death and literally everyone forgot about him and his sacrifice. It was a huge disappointment for me.

If you ever watch it again, pay attention to the nonverbal exchanges during the parlay, and watch as Will, Jack, and Elizabeth all gradually end up on the same page of the plan, while Barbossa ends up left out. From that perspective, Elizabeth‚Äôs speech ends up almost entirely intended for Barbossa‚Äôs benefit, to motivate him back into the fight by using some of his own words for inspiration.

Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, etc. Last week we watched the first three Pirates movies. I hadn't seen them in years; the first one being the only one I'd seen more than twice.

I always liked the trilogy, more so than most people, who seem to be rather critical of part 2 and 3. Having seen them again, I can definitely see where the criticism is coming from. The first one was a near flawless adventure movie, very much in the vein of a Indiana Jones film. Part 2 and 3 in comparison are rather filled with too much exposition, characters with motives and goals and generally just too much 'stuff'. Constantly thinking about what event means what for which character gets in the way of enjoying the film and ends up being a bit tiring, which I could see on my sisters reaction, but also on my own. We still ended up enjoying part 2 and 3.

But there is one thing I really admire about the Pirates movies. Considering that the first movie was born out of a theme park ride, an idea so corporate and eye-roll-inducing, those movies really had no fucking right to feature such incredibly creative, fun and awesome world-building and sense of time and place.

The fourth one, most people don‚Äôt like, though I thought it did really well and was fun while keeping most of Jack‚Äôs character there.

I despise the fifth one. Aside from the multiple plot holes in it, Jack‚Äôs character is DUMB STUPID DRUNK. Every other film he‚Äôs been cleverly witty-tipsy.

It's a movie where every shot, every sound, and every line of dialogue has a purpose. Either advancing the story, or developing the characters. Everything in the film is crafted to execute, and that's why it works so well.  
I compare it to *A New Hope* in that way. They were both fairly simple stories; with a few twists and turns, action, drama, and comedy, some fun mystical elements, and purpose-driven special effects to tie it all together.

I would also say Back to the Future is a perfect film. A tight script, many setups and payoffs (in BttF EVERY setup has a payoff) with good dialogue, it's well filmed, well paced, great characters... a perfect film. I wouldn't change a thing. 

What a great analysis man. Dead man's chest did capture the imagination. World's End did just up the extremity of most everything. I would say it's the beginning of the end of REAL Jack Sparrow, though, because he started becoming a caricature of himself. Black Pearl Jack was a swashbuckling pirate on the loose, fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants side. But he wasn't an idiot or loon. In Dead Man's chest he was similar but consumed with fear and self interest, still Jack but the situation pushed his personality. World's End Jack is still Jack but all the stuff going on is ridiculous. But at this point, Johnny Depp decided that this was normal Jack. So for the next two films, Jack is a bit too much.

5 I saw in theaters and it made me sad. Like Pirates of the Caribbean to me is that moment when you're in the boat going past the guy playing banjo, there's a mist on the water... you enter this dim tunnel and behold! A skull speaking to you! As a kid that looked real as life and it scared the hell outta me. The first half of the ride is eery and spooky, then it lightens up. But the excitement and mystery is the first part. Curse of the Black Pearl captured that. There was a good bit of that in 4 even, moreso than 3. But Pirates 5? The greatest offense to me, which is indicative of the whole movie, is the background of the end credits. It looks like a happy screensaver! It looked cheap, bright, and thrown together. 

That's my biggest gripe with 5. I mean Javier Bardem seemed to get it with his character, but the mystery and the magic was just absent from the rest of the movie. ",

You are completely taken by the action, I don't know about you but that never happens with modern blockbusters like the avengers. The third one finally offers the ending of all the numerous interests which grew on each character through previous movies (the staring game when they meet on the small island before the big fight while epic morricone's music is playing says it all).

The third one is the best in terms of everything except jack sparrow., and one of my favorite movies. The mythos and complications of jacks background are very well done. Easy to handle and they make sense for the character but jack himself just hasn't done it for me in some time, probably not since the 2nd movie.  The 5th one saw a return to a style most comparable to the 2nd movie which was a good sign.  At world's end proposed a theme that I wish the further movies had kept going with, ""Who is Jack Sparrow?""

I especially loved how the Kracken would show up several times, but each time it would be shown just a bit more, creating a sense of urgency and while the Kracken is attacking everything in the sea, our characters are trying to figure out what it is and what Davy Jones is! I think it does a wonderful job of creating a unique spin on a fairly overdone setting (pirates) and creates a dark yet comedic world of sea monsters, undead demons and gods",Binch101

I just think Depps personal issues and his turning out to be such a monumental asshole has ruined future PotC films for me.

Many franchise films are better on a second go round years later once the anticipation and disappointment wears off.  I have long thought Crystal Skull was a much better film than people give it credit for.

Another weird thing is people complaining about there being too much physical comedy and ""quipping"" in modern franchise/action movies, which I just find odd considering some of the most quoted moments of classic action films like Terminator 2 and Die Hard were played for laughs.  To me, a franchise film is successful if I feel a few different emotions throughout but ultimately come out smiling.  Kind of like a theme park.

Once they went with magic, the tension and stakes are all out the window. You can kill main characters with zero consequences as they do with Sparrow, and basically just pull out any nonsense you want to overcome the circumstances you invent.

It's dir. Gore Verbinsky at his best and the whole is done at the height of HW's fantasy renaissance, as it were. There are quite a *few* adaptations out there that deserve the genre related to 'epic romances' and both LOTR, the HP adaptations, and Pirates did that. As far as fantasy franchises go, it's still a wonderful benchmark that even its own later entries can't top. We were arguing on r/Fantasy about how the quality of 'epic fantasy' films declined because at least in the 2000s the decade had a pop-culture that existed in the shadows of 9/11 and Gulf War 2. The epic war genre can thrive in that sort of imagination, the first three Pirates films are an example -- all about the 'pirate subculture' at war. If this was made in the 1990s it'd just stop short of simply being ABOUT the pirate subculture, minus the grand stakes and military backdrop. In the 2010s, the shift in the popular imaginations has been from 'war' to 'alternate realities' (the internet and digital technology has sort of made 'other realities' more ubiquitious in this decade than it did in the last) and it's unfortunate that the pirates franchise hasn't quite managed to capture that essence as of yet. Though not for lack of trying. Any cinematic 'universe' will attest to that. Jack Sparrow bringing up the need for anonymity and other Robinsonades about the #MeToo movement? A pirate prime minister ? I know people dislike Kiera Knightley but I thought she was a very important part of the cast that made the plot compelling.

I found the pacing, especially in the first half, to be all over the place. When I reached the 1 hour mark, it felt like the actual plot was just getting started despite being almost halfway through the running time, and found myself very disappointed that the ending of the film didn't conclude the story in a satisfactory way. It felt to me that they were trying to make an ""Empire Strikes Back"" type of sequel where the cast is at their lowest point by the end, and the audience is supposed to think ""oh boy, how will our heroes get out of this pickle"" before a glimmer of hope appears. However, to me it felt slightly disingenuous, like more of a ""to be continued"" instead of setting up interesting events to come.

Additionally, I was hoping for more from the sailor mythology aspect of the world, the scenes about Davy Jones' heart and the key, where they were picking apart the legend to find the truth is very interesting to me, but I ended up having more questions then there were answers. Elements like ""Why do they turn into sea creatures"" or ""where did the kracken come from, and why does he have control over it"" were left completely up in the air. I understand that not fully understanding a supernatural thing makes it more fascinating, but to only answer some of those questions and not others felt more like they were padding content for the third installment.

My personal favorite is At World's End, it makes me sad people don't like it very much. I think it's really misunderstood.

My younger brother became obsessed with the series last year and as a result I ended up rewatching the films for the first time in years, and I found myself enjoying the a lot more than I initially did.

I think this is mostly due to the number of interwoven subplots being difficult to track unless done in successive viewing.

In many ways it's even better than the critic darlings that are the Lords of the Rings. It was harmed in terms of reviews by being based on a theme park ride instead of a respected literary work, but it has a freshness that nothing else from its time really matches. Also, nobody mentions this, but the choreography of the action scenes is fucking great. Compare the cgi heaviness and shoddy editing of the Cave Troll fight in Fellowship with the elegance of Jack's fight with Will in Curse of the Black Pearl.

The second is a mess of a script, but has probably the most iconic imagery in the series. Truth is I don't even care that the entire Pelegostos scene weights the plot down, since the tradeoff is one of the best action setpieces ever.

In the opinion the main problem with the third, more than the increasingly convoluted plot and flanderization of Jack's character, is that the massive sense of scale and high stakes \(that reading other comments here apparently some people loved, but not me\) absolutely does not fit the franchise. The Brethren Court is a terrible idea that  forces the freedom loving characters of Jack and Barbossa into the role of semi\-bureaucrats,  the new ultra complex lore doesn't fit tonally with the careless, easy going essence of being a pirate as we see it the first movie. Trying to give a bigger ""meaning"" to everything \(even Ragetti's wooden eye, damn it\) makes the movie feel too self\-important and robs the franchise of its fundamental pleasure, which was the basic fun of just going on an pirate adventure. Ironically it tried too much to be like LoTR and was harmed by that, becoming sort of a weird tonal hybrid of the two franchises.",UnderwaterSharkFight

If that awful number 4 had never come out, I think people would have responded so much better to 5.     
I feel it's a film where a large section of people just assumed it made all the same mistakes as 4 and so they never saw it or never viewed it in an open manner. Some clearly viewed it in a manner to shit on it, with all the reasons it'll suck in their mind. Checking them off at the first hint of each one.     
A large section of reviews and negative online comments read like they could have been talking about 4. If you wrote down all the reasons the next film will suck based on 4. I think those preconceived issues really clouded peoples judgement.     Y
eah difference of opinions, but I really felt a lot of reviews were all the ways a pirates sequel will suck and often the critiques didn't gel at all with my experience of the film. It was all why the franchise sucks since number 4, not caring whether 5 did the same thing, addressed those issues, did them better or even caring if it was a good and entertaining film.   
It was a franchise many had already given up on and they had firm views in their head as to why.    
It'll be a real shame if they don't get to make another sequel, 5 was really good. They got back on the right track.",LaxSagacity

Since 2 and 3 weren't as good as 1 they get a bad rap, and probably looked at harsher than they deserve. Some of the criticism is warranted, the films for example do get worse as they go on IMO

But all in all this is very similar to similar series. To make a slightly random comparison with another Disney franchise, Lion King. Lion King 1 is another example of a nigh on perfect film, and I feel both Lion King 2 and Lion King 1¬Ω get undue criticism as a result (plus being Disney direct-to-dvd sequels doesn't help).

First Film: Obviously great; It brought back that feeling I had in watching the original Star Wars films. It was just an adventure film that was done really well. It was a movie that didn't need a lot of surprises, just to invest you along the way so that the plot points felt earned. I think this is something Hollywood is forgetting. Surprises for the sake of surprises aren't satisfying. 

Second Film: I actually loved the second one at first, and I think most people initially did too, but it was one of those movies that got more hate the more it sat. The set pieces and scope of that movie, especially with the Kracken scenes are amazing. The introduction of Davy Jones, made for a wonderful character intro that was built up so much that he easily could have disappointed, but didn't. Still, I remember immediately feeling like all the story points they put out, were becoming too many, and it was going to be difficult to wrap it up by the third film in a way that was both satisfying and well earned. That film's ultimate judgement was always going to be based on how well the third one wrapped up it's (second film's) Story elements, and I think the hollow feeling from third, left the second one in a kind of purgatory, that's difficult to be judged on its own merits

Third Film: While I didn't hate it, it was the most disappointing for me. That said, I think that it was somewhat the fault of the second movie for introducing too many different story elements and moving parts like I previously mentioned. Not only did they have to wrap those up, but they introduced even MORE of those type of things. All that considered, they at least found ways to wrap up everything in ways that made sense. It just got to be too much. Though still a better movie, it suffered from the same problem as spider man 3 in that there were too many story threads that were put out, for any of their resolutions to feel earned, and meaningful. I still cared about what happened to the characters because of the threads from the previous films, but their arcs within that film, felt too rushed, convoluted, and unearned. It's a credit to the film that those arcs were easy enough to keep track of, it's just that too much happened, with too many different elements, for the character plots and motivations within that film to truly have satisfying conclusions. Decent conclusions sure, but ultimately hollow. Also, they became too reliant on ""twists."" Like I said about the first movie, a good adventure movie doesn't need to have surprises just for the sake of them. Predictable plot points that are earned through evoking emotion, is far better than a ""twist"" that doesn't grow out of a Character motivation that I'm very invested in. Investing in those character motivations takes time, time that the third movie was unable to allow for, making all those twists seem actually kind of boring because of the sheer overload of them.

I do think part of the lost luster is just the inherent nature of the where they went with the story.  So much of the excitement and love of pirates and that era of seafaring is about mystery and the romance of open possibilities.  But as the story moves on those possibilities become constrained and romance goes down not up.

That is possible because the film isn't ostensibly about Jack but Johnny Depp takes every opportunity to ham it up and steal scenes, and the editing and directing is good enough that not only does it not ruin anything but the Jack part becomes this bit of clowning chaos that is always exciting/fresh for the audience.

The issue with in the next two films is that they pull focus and make Jack's mythology the focus. That in and of itself is fine because Will and Elizabeth don't really have sufficient back story you could use to fashion more episodes from. But once Jack is the focus Johnny Depp no longer has the room to upstage the other players, he is already the focus, so there's no limelight to steal. Hamming it up more is no longer adding anything, the audience already get it so there's no need to lay it on as thick.

One of my favorite things about the first one was how well the absurd and the serious interacted and gave each other greater effect. It was a movie that was funny, rather than a ""funny movie,"" and contrasts between, say, Jack Sparrow the professional spiral in a world of straight lines, and the ramrod-backed British Navy, lawful-good characters like Will and Elizabeth, and more straightforward other pirates, were really, really good.

Things like the beautiful audacity of Jack Sparrow, from the brig, yelling ""Stop blowing holes in my ship!"" would have been just another funny bit in a movie full of them in one of the later movies, but where it is, it's absolutely perfect.",Cypraea

Lots of movies don't take themselves seriously nowadays. I would even argue that the number is actually far higher than back when Black Pearl released, because of the huge success of superhero movies since. Pretty much all franchises don't nowadays, including Marvel, DC, Mission Impossible, Jurassic World, Star Wars, etc.

However, I do agree with you in a sense. The comedy in the Black Pearl just works so well in a way that it doesn't in blockbusters nowadays, the newest PotC movie included. The comedy is just sort of crammed in there to ensure forced levity. It makes it so that any dramatic moments feel like they have no weight to them. I like the Black Pearl not because it knew when *not* to take itself seriously, but because it knew when it *should*. The comedy works AND the dramatic moments also work in that movie.",Karlzone

Agreed. This is perfectly cemented by how they treated the Jack Sparrow character. You all know what I mean. He went from so clever and insane, that the audience questions whether he's just insane or incredibly clever or both, to comedic relief. The fact that he controls the plot and the catalyst for the events unfolding while the audience and the other characters figure this out is what made that character brilliant. Disney failed to figure that out, and assumed it's because of the wacky hi-jinks and his goofy mannerisms alone.

> At this point, The Franchise is just that, a franchise. Maybe someone will come along with an interesting tale in that universe. I hope so.

The only way they pull it off is if the original creators have a proper story to tell or another talented crew has a brilliant idea for the universe. It will never work if Disney puts the cart before the horse; lays out a release date and tells whoever they hire to rush to meet that deadline.

The end result is the character becomes a caricature of himself. 

A good example is The Big Bang Theory, which could be renamed the Sheldon show. They discovered one character polled as more popular than the rest so they made him more prominent and extreme but ended up ruining the balance. 

This also happens with directors. When the Hateful Eight came out I was nervous, because I knew Tarantino had become popular enough and had made enough movies that he was at risk of being less creative, and more focused on what he knew historically worked and made him popular. Sure enough, although a good movie, it was my least favorite of his, and again felt like a caricature version of his other films. 

This also happens to actors who get type casted such as Will Ferrel ",buddboy

Originally he was designed as more of a bugs bunny type character (clever, loveable jerk, able to one up an authority figure etc) it was Johnny Depp who figured that pirates were like the rockstars of their time and based Jack on the most piratey rockstar he could think of - Keith Richards (hence the multiple cameos) and through that portrayed him as a staggering drunk. (thanks dvd commentary) 
I think because of this, the writers didn't write Jack in the sequels Like he was originally conceived, but as he was ultimately portrayed, loosing some of what made him so fun in the original.
Fun fact: the script was based off of another script that writers had been working on for some time. A Monkey Island movie. Which really explains alot when you think about it
Additional fun fact: Monkey Island was based/inspired off of the novel ""on stranger tides"" so the film series kind of came around full circle. ",paggo_diablo

A lot of people say that in the second and third one he becomes a bloated caricature of himself, but I don‚Äôt think so at all (although he kind of is in the 4th one and COMPLETELY is in the 5th one). Throughout Dead Mans chest, jack is manipulating everyone and scheming to accomplish his own ends, just like in the first one. The difference in this one is the characters are more daring and assertive when it comes to dealing with him (The whole fight for the key is the perfect example not to mention IMO one of the greatest adventure/action sequences ever). Same with the third when he strikes his deal with Beckett, or battles Jones for the chest, or steals the map from Barbossa. I love the fact that none of the characters have some real unspoken bond (for the most part) because they are pirates after all. Like in the Chest when they‚Äôre trying to escape the cannibals and each cage with the crew is racing to the Pearl, perfectly content to leave the others behind. Or when Will is content to let Norrington kill Jack, or when Elizabeth and the two pirate guys (I forget their names) are about to fight, but are suddenly on each others side when the Dutchman crew shows up.

I would even argue that the number is actually far higher than back when Black Pearl released, because of the huge success of superhero movies since. Pretty much all franchises don't nowadays, including Marvel, DC, Mission Impossible, Jurassic World, Star Wars, etc.

I agree with you. But those movies still feel very different. I agree with you that the comedy feels crammed in there, forced at times and then they try to be serious the next minute. Take the pacman moment from GOTG2 or the dance moment in the last fight in GOTG1. I never liked GOTG much personally. I feel like the comedy gets predictable after a while. They're more like Pirates of the Caribean 4+ for me.  As in the latter Pirates films Jack Sparrow becomes a bit too much. They sacrifice his serious side for more ""comedic moments"". 

This reminds me as well of when I compare The Office US to Brooklyn Nine Nine. The Office was ridiculous at times but the character still had a real and serious side. While Brooklyn Nine Nine sacrifices the serious and realistic side of characters, to create more comedic moments. The issue is that it's just cheap jokes in the end and gets old real quick. While The Office US could still maintain a coherent narrative with realistic characters while still being fun.

Firstly, the EITC was a trade cartel that ""pirated"" ships themselves and toppled governments and set up colonies in the name of profit. Imagine the most ruthless company you know, with navies and armies to back them up in anything they wanted to do.

Second...A large number of pirates were escaped naval sailors. At the time, Britain's navy was not so voluntary. Press gangs would roam the streets, beating people up and kidnapping them to crew ships. You'd wake up at sea and congratulations, you're in the navy.

This is also the reason beer typically comes in glasses nowadays. Recruiting officers would go to bars and buy rounds, and slip a shilling into the bottom. Once you accepted the drink, you ""took the king's shilling"" (your first pay check) and were now in the navy. Glass-bottomed vessels were initially a way to curb this practice.

So this practice often lead to mutiny. And if you mutinied, you were dead if you were ever caught. So crews that rose up against their captors were de facto pirates, having committed murder and hijacked something that was *insanely* expensive, and they had to continue that path to survive. That's the origin of many buccaneers.

Then there were privateers. Governments like those of Britain, France and Spain routinely authorised individuals to plunder ships of rival nationalities, offering a license legitimising it in return for a cut of the goods.",redwall_hp

This is what I mean by understanding the time period and competing interests. The East India Company was a private company by this time period, that had been sanctioned by two governments. The company had become greedy and some what irresponsible, because they were now challenging the very governments who sanctioned them in more than a few places. Keep in mind that at some point pirates worked for the British, French, Dutch and Spanish governments against each other. Then you have the pirates just trying to survive as independents.  

Then comes all the love stories. Will for his father. Will for Elizabeth, Davey for Calypso, in that I hate you so much bitch, that I love you way.

At some point, I believe they realized that Kramer would naturally steal the whole show and started working to make sure that didn't happen.  Kramer just had that right mix of charisma, a well-written character, comic timing, and exceptional comedic acting that threatened to make him a dominant force.

However, I think those are minor and understandable problems/difficulties that I could more easily overlook if I didn't sort of hate the characters.

I don't know if those are good choices for you though. Probably ""Interesting Times"" would be what I would recommend - his older stuff is more physical comedic style, and his newer works are more philosophical, so this is a good crossover between the two. The humor is good, he's not too heavy with social issues, and it involves Rincewind who is his first, er for lack of a better term, protagonist.

If we're talking about the original meaning of the word that the ancient Greeks used, it's super simple: the lead actor, the one with the most screen time, is Orlando Bloom. 

If we're talking about it in the more modern sense, in the way that Syd Field, Robert McKee, Blake Snyder, William Goldman, or Steven King have written about the concept, the protagonist is the character that drives the movie's plot forward. 

In the first movie, that character is Will:

Will's inciting incident determines the arc of the film, and the resolution of his storyline is the film's resolution as well. Jack Sparrow is a support character because no matter how important he is to the film (and in a well-written film, every speaking role should be important because why else are they eating precious screen time?) it is not his story. It is Will's. 

I agree that the movie belongs to Jack Sparrow and Johnny Depp. He stole every frame he was dropped into, unquestionably, and that is why he was placed front and center of every movie thereafter. You would be hard-pressed to find anyone who didn't think Johnny Depp was the best part of the movie. That doesn't change the fact that the Jack Sparrow character is, in the first film, a supporting role.

There was even a deleted scene that reveals they hired Jack Sparrow to transport a shipment, and when he discovered the cargo was human slaves he released them. Freeing the slaves is what set Sparrow on the wrong side of the law and led him to piracy. IMO the scene should have been left in precisely to better set up who‚Äôs good and who‚Äôs bad in *Pirates*.

> There was a goblin, or a trickster, or a warrior. A nameless, terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most feared being in all the cosmos. And nothing could stop it, or hold it, or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world...

The Doctor has built up this reputation of being the most dangerous thing in the universe, but half the time it comes down to dumb luck. Even when he's trying to be a manipulative chessmaster, like in the Sylvester McCoy stories, he often misses something important and has to improvise a new solution.

Some stories, like *The Parting of the Ways* and *The Face of Evil*, also have the Doctor return to places where he's been before, only to find that his previous actions actually ended up leading to even worse oppression than before.

This line from Peter Capaldi's episode *Death in Heaven* sums the Doctor up pretty well, I think. He's spent the whole series questioning if he's been a good man or not, and comes to this conclusion:

> ""I am *not* a good man! I am not a bad man. I am not a hero. And I'm definitely not a president. And no, I'm not an officer. Do you know what I am? I... am... an idiot! With a box and a screwdriver. Just passing through, helping out, learning.""",protomenfan200x

The prophecy could've been just easily Neville, but everyone decided it was Harry. 

That makes the scene with Dumbledore in King's Cross the crux of the series. For the first time Harry gets autonomy over his fight with Voldemort. It's not other people's projections forcing him too. He had done what was needed of him (dying and making Voldemort mortal). But with the Deathly Hallows he could go back if he wanted to save his friends, but he could also rest in death. He chooses the former, and that's the power of the series.

>Regardless about whether a time turner was involved giving him confidence, he still cast that Patronus completely on his own.

Regardless about whether he cast that patronus ""on his own"", a time turner was still involved giving him literally unshakeable confidence, something that would allow nearly *anyone* to cast a patronus. 

In fact, before using the time turner, Harry failed completely to repel the dementors with his patronus on the shore of the lake, showing explicitly that the time turner hack is the reason he could pull it off. ‚ÄúI knew I could do it all this time, because I'd already done it"". If not for the time turner hack he'd be dead. 

>When Ron and Hermione are trying to convince him to lead the DA he says all kinds of things to downplay his abilities. They consider him much more skilled than he considers himself.

Just because they think he's more skilled doesn't mean he is. He doesn't say things to downplay his ability, he explains that he lucked and hacked his way through it, which is the truth. Ron comes to understand this in book 7:

'Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcux. Saving my life.'¬†
'That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,' Ron mumbled.
'Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,' said Harry. 'I've been trying to tell you that for years.'",Keegan320

I've got a few theories about the various mechanics and consequences of this whole area of magical theory, but 

1) the horcrux-making just locks part of the soul away to use it as an anti-death anchor, it's *murder* that splits the soul, which means Voldemort's soul likely resembles a whole roll of toilet paper separated into individual squares, all flapping around like confused bats or something, and

2) Voldemort started making horcruxes with his first few murders, which means the pieces he locked away in them were a lot bigger fractions of his whole self than any of the later ones. 

In fact, his *first* murder (Moaning Myrtle) got made into his first horcrux (the diary), meaning that there's half of him locked away already. His second horcrux, the ring, was done after he'd just committed three more murders (his father and paternal grandparents), so that was another third or so of the half that was left, and the murder of old Hepzibah Smith in order to horcruxify either the locket or the cup would have been quite likely the next one on.

Assuming that the soul fragment that goes into the horcrux is one-half the freshest, made-for-the-purpose split each time, and assuming that the largest soul fragment present splits with each new murder, he was probably at this point done with the major damage of losing large parts of himself to horcruxes, but the damage of shredding his soul into mass-murder confetti is likely pretty significant as well. These soul fragments would have a *volume* that likely contributed to his consciousness being greater than that of any of the later horcruxes, but I would guess that his consciousness and his connection to reality are, at this point, impressively shattered, and I find it likely that the stray piece that split off with Lily's murder latched onto Harry because it was confused enough to mistake Harry for the rest of itself (perhaps helped by the fact that, after the Killing Curse backfired from Harry, Harry's was the only soul present in the room).

It's also possible that due to that reaction, ONLY the largest fragment that most housed Voldemort's consciousness managed to hang onto that tether and not vanish into the afterlife, or only six or so (whatever number of horcruxes he had made at that point) pieces managed it, each of them grabbing at one of the existing horcruxes to stay on the mortal plane and scrambling his consciousness so much that it took him over a decade to recover even to the point of managing to talk to someone like Quirrell.

Note that Harry is so viscerally repulsed by the soul fragment's representation that he cannot bring himself to touch it, and Dumbledore states with finality that it is beyond help; I'm thinking this was due to more than Voldemort's evilness, but that it is too small and shredded to function as a person on its own, sort of the equivalent of scraping up a pound or so of pulped flesh with a bit of recognizable spleen in it after a bad car accident and trying to restore a living person out of it; with its physical host, it can be an anchor for Voldemort's consciousness, but without that, it is nothing.

But, anyway, point being is, I'm pretty sure the soul fragment inside Harry was nowhere near an eighth.",Cypraea

It's Javier Bardem as an unhinged spanish pirate ghost? Are you kidding me? Depp can phone it in all he wants as long as Salazar gets his time in the spotlight to make up for it.

It's worth noting too that Blackbeard looked awesome (to be fair- it's Ian Mcshane, the man doesn't really have to try to look awesome), but didn't really.....do much. Salazar on the other hand looks menacing as fuck, and personally guts handfuls of men through the movie, leads his men into battle, and is constantly on Jack's tail. ...Except when he buys into Barbossa's bullshit. Thrice. But I'm willing to forgive that because of his awesome introduction. The THUMP of his boots landing on the beat of his theme.. oof.

Both had their great moments though. Blackbeard showing off the control he has over his ship, and his ''I will have one last fight, by God...'' when Barbossa shows up at the end come to mind.

He represented a sense of realism within the Pirates of the Caribbean films since the East India Company did exist in real life...and he used his organization like a mallet to get what he wanted: control of the ocean.

Heck!  He ultimately owned Davy Jones by the end of Dead Man's Chest and used him as his attack dog in At World's End.  Tom Hollander played him with cool menace - very subdued when compared to the more hammy performances.

The first movie is the best movie for two very simple reasons.

1) it is its own complete standalone adventure with a beginning middle and end.

2) the character of jack sparrow wasn‚Äôt written as Johnny Depp‚Äôs insane vision of a pirate. He had normal, albeit funny dialogue and all the affectations came through in the performance. In the sequels, Jack Sparrow is a huge cartoon character bc they tried to write in those affectations instead of just trusting JD with the performance.",bensawn

Honestly At Worlds End and On Strange Tides is a harder choice for me. AWE felt a little bit less cartoonish and it had some epic battles but it was the worst out of the original trilogy. OST didn‚Äôt have to worry about concluding the story ark and the lack of pressure I think helped it be more fun and self contained. I think though the newest one was my least favorite. Depp seemed down and off. At the time I thought it was because he was guilty and felt the mask slipping but now I see the situation with Heard is a lot more nuanced.

The first movie was as generic as a pirate story could be. Within the first 15 minutes of it I knew everything that was going to happen in the rest of the film with the exception that I thought the pirates were slowly turning into skeletons. This only ‚Äúoriginal‚Äú plot element of the film came from the ride. The only stand out elements of this movie are the opening credits and Johnny Depp‚Äôs performance. Basing his portrayal of Jack Sparrow off of Kieth Richards was such a unique idea and was so beautifully executed that you can ignore that blandness of everything after he steps off that sinking ship.

Rather than being just another generic pirate story, the sequels raised things like Davey Jones and the Kraken from vague elements in sailor‚Äôs stories to epic mythological forces within global culture. I also deeply enjoyed that they made the historical East India Trading Company into a symbol of how the forces of power during the Enlightenment destroyed a sense of magic in the world.

It feels like two scripts hastily combined into one, with Jack being introduced twice for some reason (once in the coffin and once on the island) and the island sequence is entirely too long and superfluous to justify its place in the story. It‚Äôs also the silliest Jack got until the 5th one this year. 

Oddly enough, I enjoy the 4th movie a lot more than most people. It felt like a return to form for Jack, who comes off as competent and cunning again, and I LOVE Ian McShane in any role. ",NardsOfDoom
movies,7zwq4y,Does Pirates of the Caribbean series really have only one good movie? What about Dead Mans Chest?,durqhfi,2018-02-24 19:49:33,"I‚Äôve always thought the big problem with 2 & 3 is the fact they went down the route of deciding the first film was part of an EPIC TRILOGY and then they went about creating an EPIC TRILOGY because a film about undead pirates and an 18th century Keith Richards in a pirate hat is really the stuff of an EPIC TRILOGY - hence bogging the sequels down in plot, useless characters, a pointless cliffhanger and one movie‚Äôs plot stretched over the best part of 5-6 hours.

The sequels always should have been standalone adventures that reunited Will, Liz and Jack into high-sea capers which resolved themselves at the end and always in the hope of another adventure... they wanted to make Star Wars and LOTR when they should have been going for Indiana Jones and a ‚Äògang is back together again‚Äô vibe. 

The big problems with 4 & 5 was that they actually missed Will and Elizabeth who gave the the franchise a nice bland foundation to let Jack goof off in the corner and instead expected him to drive the stories - neither of which worked in my opinion. ",dr_buggerlugs

However, my wife and I hold unpopular views on this series. We love the first one, really love the second one. Further, we like the third one a lot and think the Maelstrom sequence is some of the best stuff in the series.

The fourth one is fun in a few parts, but a let down.

The fifth one surprised us. We loved it. I'd put it back up with 1-3, a full redemption from the fourth one.

Sure, the plot gets a little convoluted but the art direction is amazing, it's shot beautifully and say what you will about Orlando Bloom's wooden acting but the rest of the cast pull it off incredibly well.

Also, grim as the tone is/gets, there's solid moments of levity. The slapstick is memorable and the physical gags never get old. The cannibal island stuff goes on for a little long but I don't feel this really does in the pacing. I'd also make the argument that there are a fair few scenes that do zilch for the plot, such as most of the cannibal island setpiece. Why is Jack being a chief important? Why did Jack end up there?

-The first film had an unpredictable, 'rollicking pirate adventure' pacing. The next two just became a series of betrayals and short term alliances and supernatural plot devices.

-Once Will and Elizabeth got comfortable hanging out on pirate ships, they weren't as effective as the audience surrogate. They just became two more variables that were liable to help or betray Jack Sparrow at any moment.

-Davy Jones was a surprisingly well-done CGI character, but frankly, no pirate/monster villain was nearly as good as Barbosa. The franchise was glaringly aware of this. For whatever reason, the British antagonists were never written particularly well after the first film, either.",EaseofUse

They over used jokes that worked in the first film but got less funny ever time they appeared, all of a sudden Elizabeth Swan is a badass sword woman and Johnny Depp seem to go on autopilot for the sequels.

Even the plots made little to no sense:

In the second film the villainous trading company want Davey Jones's heart because with that they control him and The Kraken and thus will have complete control of the seas.  But then in the next film we find out that these assholes ordered Davey Jones to kill his pet which makes the previous film pointless.  Of course the reason it was killed was because in Dead Man's Chest it was pretty much established it can't be defeated so the thing had to be killed off screen so our heroes wouldn't have to confront it again.

The third film all of a sudden has Elizabeth Swan becoming a pirate queen and giving stupid speeches to the Pirate Brethren about freedom.  This is not Braveheart and these are not freedom fighters protecting their land they are fucking pirates.",MovieMike007

There's no real sense that anyone will ever get stabbed. When someone does get the drop on another character, they spout dialogue rather than stab. That allows Jack to get away so they can have another confrontation at another set-piece later in the movie.  Rinse and repeat.

Also, it had TWO openings, what the fuck? One where Will's son summons his father, one where Will's son meets Javier Bardem. And none of them mattered, nor did he as a character. He wasn't even the main character. The film shoulda begun with Jack at his best (flashback scene), with him at his worst (the rest of the Jack scenes), and then be heavily focused on Barbossa and his daughter, whose name I can't remember. I'll call her Eliza for now. I feel like that was just tossed in, really inconveniantly. And heck, even when they introduced the idea, they did absolutely nothing with it. They blew two chances on offering Barbossa to reconcile with her, and offer her the love that he has left in him. But both times, they have Jack be an idiot. These moments are when it's revealed that Barbossa talks with Jack about her on the ship, and when they arrive at that island. Y'know, they coulda had the two of them go out and have a chat about stars and family. Instead, they send her out with Jack. And Jack... Look, you can be a bumbling idiot all you like, as long as I can see how toxic you are and that you're trying to get better. But you were the absolute worst pain in the ass ever. Fuck you, Jack Sparrow #5. Fuck you.

And Will's son, most useless character in the whole movie. What the fuck was that? And what's Will doing there. The fact that you show him as the first thing in the movie, intrigues me to believe he would've come crashing in, ex machina style, with the Flying Dutchman, to help save his son. But no. It starts and ends with him, to prove a point to him or something. What the fuck?

Barbossa's sacrifice makes sense to me, but I did not feel it. It was all structured so badly. It wanted to be a serious drama so bad, but felt it couldn't handle not being a dumb comedy. The only time anything was good, was when they mixed comedy with action, AKA Guillotine scene, which is perfection. Also, I'm ashamed to say this, but I laughed so much at the witch gags. That donkey was unexpected. Some of the sexual humor could've been turned down a bit, but I guess some of it worked in parts.

I guess it's enjoyable in parts. But it's so fucking disappointing. Especially when you got all these beautiful, expensive sets, costumes, makeup, amazing actors, great soundtrack, just everything.

Not only did this mean he could be very specific about the quality of the effects he wanted, he was also able to film every scene in such a way that the VFX artists working on the films had the best material to work with.

The DVD for Dead Man's Chest came with *hours* of behind-the-scenes footage which is honestly some of the best BTS I've ever seen. Never a dull moment and it went into a lot of detail on a number of scenes.

One that sticks out in my mind is the first kraken attack; when it splits the ship in two it looks amazing because *they actually filled a pipe with concrete and dropped it on a ship!* A lot of the effects are practical mixed with digital, which means they hold up really well all these years later.",DarkNinjaPenguin

Most of them had intense studio interventions as well, with or without the director's/VFX team's consent. 

What I'm saying is: if some mid-2000s movies had better CGI, it was mostly because back then studios weren't as hands-on and didn't try to sabotage the productions weeks before their release to this degree. I know the exceptions, you don't have to list them to me ^^

That being said, I agree that most of today's movies aren't nearly as good in terms of CGI than the PotC trilogy. Why? Because A. PotC cost a shitload of money to make and B.

I miss how bold movies used to be with their visual effects. I think the last true hurrah was Avatar.   

Though as an outlier, Infinity War had some pretty crazy shit, mainly the fight to get the gauntlet from Thanos, breath taking. But that doesn't describe most of the action in the Disney Marvel series, which is usually pretty timid. and don't even get me started on how lame and safe the SFX in the new Star Wars movies are.

At the time it was a really surprising choice because 1. Live-action DPs were not often asked to work on an animated film, if not at all, and 2. Roger Deakins had never really worked with big CGI movies anyway, since he likes natural light and warm, sun-lit hues. He ended up being essential to the film's quality, because he would advise the animators on what light should look like in every scene (beyond the limited algorithm of a bleeding edge computer software), and on how to make it more ''grounded''. 

I won't say Rango's a revolution though, because George Miller and James Cameron had already started to explore all this hidden fa√ßade of animation via Happy Feet 1&2 and Avatar. But it's nice to see that a competent director looked at their work and thought ''how can I learn from those guys and try my own thing?'' Rango's not Mocap, but the way Gore worked with animators is quite similar to Miller's and Cameron's",ConcreteRoad

 The special effects in Jurassic Park(the CGI sequences) certainly don‚Äôt look brand new. But they totally hold up in the sense that the effects still fit the movie. They aren‚Äôt the best for 2020 but they compliment the animatronics and the tone perfectly.  There‚Äôs no parts that take me out of the film watching it today.

However there‚Äôs some films where i see it 5 years later and say ‚Äúholy shit that looks nothing like I remember. This looks so bad it‚Äôs almost like a different film‚Äù.

I think aged well is a better way to say it.",PTfan

movies,igjwh0,"I can say with ease that the first four Pirates of the Caribbean movies(curse of the Black Pearl,dead man's chest,at world's end,on stranger Tides) are to me what the original star wars trilogy is to star wars fans",g2ua7gc,2020-08-25 20:45:11,"I feel like your on to something but if I could add my own opinions I‚Äôd add: 

The first one was indeed amazing, I am a supporter of the next two because I enjoy the overarching story. But beyond those 3 the franchise does go through a fundamental shift centering around my next point. The main characters of the film changes to Jack Sparrow. That‚Äôs my next personal opinion, Jack Sparrow was part of the main characters but not the focus. In fact the story of the first three movies center almost completely on Will Turner and Elizabeth and Jack is an elevated side character for the most part.

I do think the whole franchise has been unfairly looked down on. While I understand the burn out after the first 4 (and now we‚Äôre getting a boringly competent version of Jungle Cruise as a response to the success of PotC), I think history will be more kind to the original trilogy of films.",Skele11

It's at great as the first 3 or even the 4th, but I liked the concept. I get why they choose to replace the old caslove couple with some new ones, even if it did not work.
Young Jack was a funny idea and I would welcome a prequel with him.",GregDinyx
