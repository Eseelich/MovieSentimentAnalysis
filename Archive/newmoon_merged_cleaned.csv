195ev5t,New Moon still destroys me,khpbf5r,2024-01-13 18:51:58,I really used to romanticize the zombie state that she goes into during those few months before she starts working on the bikes with Jacob. I just liked the idea of turning off and having people around me be concerned. I remember loving the moment that Edward hears/sees her night terrors and screaming (I think through Charlie?) it’s so validating to me. I have a victim complex sometimes 👀,chunkynut0

195ev5t,New Moon still destroys me,khorfa4,2024-01-13 16:54:36,"It’s honestly for me one of the best moments in the whole series. Very rarely do filmmakers manage to portray depression in a way that feels so visceral and real to me. They show the whole world going on as normal with a quiet person in the middle, showing what outsiders perceive of your depression, they don’t usually get how it actually feels from the inside, not looking out because there is no out, you’re just inside yourself, trapped in your pain and barely aware of anything around you. That part of the films and books, Bella’s depression, makes me feel hollow, empty. It speaks to the depression that I’ve felt, and makes me think that SM has to have been through it too, if she writes it so well.",gillz88uk

195ev5t,New Moon still destroys me,khmnkm9,2024-01-13 04:58:18,"Absolutely. It was a beneficial thing that things ended with my first actual boyfriend. It was a whirlwind, I fell too fast and became too dependent. A week or two before he broke up with me, it was like a switch flipped in him. He always was “too busy” to spend time together and even when we were together things felt disjointed. I was uneasy and panicked for those two weeks, dreading what was coming, and it was almost a relief when he finally broke up with me. Being in that limbo state was a terrible feeling! 
Also, the guy was a total jerk - but I was blind to it because of my feelings for him. Now I’m happily married (going on 9 years) to the best guy in the world and it’s wonderful! 🩷",merrymeganberry

My favourite part of the entire book starts about page 115 and ends around 192, and it consists entirely of Bella and Jacob bonding because it's probably the most pure and honest their relationship gets before the complications start and before asshole Jacob comes out to play. 

The red-brown aesthetic is far more my thing than the cold blue filter of the first film, and the scenery in the films is some of the best.",DeadDeathrocker

I get why he was hurt, he loved her, they almost took that step and them BAM! He smelled a vampire and wanted to keep her safe bc I assume he thought the vampire he smelled was Victoria and the woman he loved was going to risk her life for someone who left her and hurt her so deeply.

pbasnz,what's your opinion on new moon?,had7jtk,2021-08-26 01:00:25,"Having just gone through some stuff I found the movie to be surprisingly accurate. Great music too, the best in the series I'd say. 

The book was the movie times 10. Bella and Jacob coming so close to working things out, only for everything to become so complicated again when Alice returned was kind of gut-punchy and honestly had me in a gloomy mood for a handful of days. 

People dismiss their relationship but it honestly might've worked. 

There's a bit of a drag in the middle but the beginning and everything after Laurent's return is impeccable, possibly eclipsing (no pun intended?) the first book with its weight and atmosphere. 

Honestly a rocksolid Sequel.

Like, dude, you're not thinking long term. Victoria was still on the hunt, and if it weren't for Jake and his pack of brothers, Laurent would have unalived her anyway.",krscarbro
142q9y4,How have I never noticed this about New Moon?,jn70aes,2023-06-07 00:41:43,"This one has a lot of feels for me. Jacob was there for Bella, yes. Bella would never have recovered from the loss of Edward without him, no doubt. My only issue is that Jacob had feeling for Bella the entire time, and as much as he cared for her as a friend, he was always hoping for and hinting at a *romantic* future for them. 

Bella made it clear on multiple occasions that she viewed Jacob as a friend, a brother. Yes, she loved him, she admits as much to herself when he almost a kisses her in the kitchen scene when Edward/Carlisle calls and he answers their phone. But she knows then she doesn’t love him that way, but could *choose* if she wanted him. 

With that in mind, everything Jacob did had the undercurrent of an agenda or motive to end up with Bella at the time. I loved Jacob as a character that, in my mind, was a vehicle or plot device to make Bella grow up and truly embrace who she is meant to be. His presence and feelings for her force her to stand and choose the life she wants, and unfortunately, hurts the hell out of Jacob in the process. 

Jacob’s imprinting on Reconstruction is weird, but not a consolation prize. IMO, it forces Jacob to grow up, be the Alpha he is meant to be, and a part of Bella’s family in the only way he can. I think it worked out the only way it could. Just one opinion.",
142q9y4,How have I never noticed this about New Moon?,jn6824i,2023-06-06 21:19:26,"In the book, Edward takes her up a little path from her house. The Swan house is at the edge of a forest, but Edward takes Bella only a little distance away; the house was still visible. It's just that when he took off, she tried to follow him and wound up in the middle of the woods",Emma_Cavill
142q9y4,How have I never noticed this about New Moon?,jn7jrpp,2023-06-07 03:16:13,"Jacob literally kept Bella alive when sir Edward was on hiking and soul searching (sarcasm). So yes. I do think that Jacob is thrown out like a weed among roses when Edward is back. 

Depression - Jacob was there 
Jumping from cliff - Jacob was there
Laurent - Jacob was there 
Victoria - Jacob was there 

If I see things from Bella’s PoV I’m glad she never gave Jacob, any kind of false hopes. She thought of him as a very very good friend (platonic love) and she also confessed that she will never be able to have same gravity of feelings towards someone else (in theatre when she said I’m not a bike which you can fix). But, she knew anyway that Jacob loved him. In any other situation, I think she would let Jacob go to keep the distance so it doesn’t hurt him. But, because of Edward’s loss she was barely alive and in a desperate need of any sort of good friendship and companionship. Any human would not be able to let go of that connection in the situation she was in because you NEED it. Bad for Jacob though. 

I love Edward but I hate the whole arc of him leaving Bella in a forest of all places and Bella accepting him back like he went on day trip. He deserved a bit of tough time for it.",Rebekka-h
142q9y4,How have I never noticed this about New Moon?,jn7sqx0,2023-06-07 04:40:48,"Okay, so I'm torn. For myself, I prefer Jacob. I feel very much at home with the pack. I love their rowdiness and roughousing. I love the camaraderie, and the raw masculine energy. I would've chosen Jacob, for me.

But Bella chose Edward, from the moment she saw him. And I think Edward is right for Bella. I understand Bella's passion for Edward, because I had a love in my life like that, and I understand the utter desolation and emptiness of her loss when he left.

Also, I know vampires don't 'imprint' like wolves do, but they do each seem to have a 'soul mate'. You can see it in each of the vampire couples. Once they find their mate, they're pretty much bonded for life. Or undeath. Or... whatever you consider their existence. Bella was Edward's mate. (I do wish Stephanie had written it so that Bella only smelled that good to Edward, and that would've turned out to be a sign that she was his soul mate. But I digress.)

On the subject of imprinting, I actually think it was selfish of Jacob to try so hard to win Bella's love. If he'd had his way and she fell in love with him, he always had to know there was a chance he'd imprint on someone else. And then Bella would've been left broken-hearted and alone, like Leah. That's s nasty thing for a wolf to consciously do to someone they love.",RockyMntnView
142q9y4,How have I never noticed this about New Moon?,jn6n48a,2023-06-06 23:03:01,"Tbh I'm team Jacob all the way. Maybe one reason for that is that I simply like the shifters and their energy more than vampires and I think it would be soo cool if your hubby could transform into a wolf xD

But back to Jacob: I really love New Moon-Jacob, as some people already said in this comment section. He was so caring and sweet even though Bella acted strange after Edward left. But I don't totally get the hate on Eclipse-Jacob - Bella kind of kept him warm and didn't let him go completely what was a huge reason why their relationship is so fucked-up in that part. So I don't blame Jacob alone for that but Bella in equal parts (really didn't like her in the movies that much). And just think about how he was there for her in Breaking Dawn again, even though she basically broke his heart. Besides this, nobody is perfect and everybody has flaws - can't judge a few questionable desicions or actions when overall his intentions were good.",Mysterious-Lychee98

I was *just* taking about this with a male friend and I mentioned that I thought it was sweet Jacob took initiative to be her friend even though they didn’t really hang around each other in the first book. He stared at me and said when *he* read that part, he was waiting for the other shoe to drop where Jacob springs his affection on Bella once they become good friends.

1h9z7z4,Does anyone fine it hard watching new moon?,m1a1j7v,2024-12-09 23:55:56,"New Moon is my third favorite of the franchise, nearly tying with BD2. 

Bella’s heart crushing angst tears at us all. It’s literally physically painful to watch and Lykke Li’s “Possibility” is a perfect song. I always imagine that the song is for Alice, who would be the only one who would know if Bella’s heart stopped because she’d see it (at least until later in the movie when Jacob phased and was near her). 

And New Moon would have been a perfect Romeo and Juliet reimagining if it weren’t for the scene that makes me want to risk shattering my hand by punching Edward in the face and that’s this: 

Bella flies to Italy to save him and while she’s still in his arms, he says, “I lied. And you believed me so easily.” Isn’t that putting the blame on her? Her heart was being ripped from her chest and all he could say is she believed him so easily? Really? He should have been begging for her forgiveness at that point.

So does that mean if she had only said, “I don’t believe you. I know you’re lying to protect me,” when he was breaking up with her that he would have said, “yeah, you’re right. Sorry.”

Idk, I read it when I was in quite the rut myself and it felt immensely comforting, there's just this thick melancholic atmosphere to it that's oddly enjoyable to bask in. 

Some great scenes and imagery, a palpable atmosphere, a wonderfully angsty doomed relationship and an exciting, cathartic finale with a happy ending that actually feels happy for the time being (unlike others in the series). 

The model of literary parallels also works best with the Romeo and Juliet theme here. 

It's honestly a strong contender for my favorite book in the series, maybe after Eclipse. 

It's also quite important for the latter since the central, eponymous conflict of Eclipse is about resolving the love triangle that New Moon created. 

All in all it's a great and vital middle part of the, how I like to call it, Victoria-trilogy that SMeyers publisher _thankfully_ asked her for.

I don't believe Bella wanted to kill herself when she jumped (simply because the scene is not written as a suicide attempt). However, I agree that she should admit that once she was in the water and was dying, she was more than willing to stop fighting. However, Edward's voice is part of her subconscious, and the voice definitely doesn't want her to give up, which means that SHE doesn't really want to give up. 
And also, besides herself, who would she admit that to ? Charlie would freak out and she wouldn't want to hurt him like that, and if she told any of the Cullen's, it would inevitably pop into their mind at some point when Edward is around and he would freak out too.

That being said, Edward might have been more agreeable to changing her if she'd admitted point blank that she would kill herself rather than living without him (before he left that is). 

I never read the saga as a teenager, only as an adult (26y-o) when I read it for the first time, and re-read several times since then. And I absolutely agree with you, Jacob is insufferable in New Moon, and the whole thing is depressing.

It is more. This is something the fandom needs to understand. Jacob's not imagining their romantic connection. Bella just won't accept it because she's too hung up on someone who's not even around anymore. And by the time New Moon ends, if Edward stayed away, they would've been a couple.

That was never happening. Once she got a taste of the supernatural world, a normal dude was never gonna be enough.

She didn't want to die. She wanted to see Edward. Bella wasn't depressed by the time the werewolf plot starts. Jacob did make her happy.

They're extremely comforting when you're in *that* mood; the scenery is beautiful, the vibes, aesthetic, and colour scheme is warm; and the dialogue/soundtrack itself is very gentle and anti sensory overload (the only way I can efficiently describe it), as in, you can have it on while you're reading, working, etc. and it doesn't overwhelm your senses.

That's of course, besides going into the heavier details of the storytelling which you've described, but I'm glad someone else gets it. Some people only look as far as ""there's no Edward"" which is something I'd expect a pre-teen/teenager to say.",DeadDeathrocker

We get Bella and the Cullens pretending everything is alright in the beginning, that going horribly wrong, everyone paying the price for the majority of the book and then a solution in the finale, where they all reunite and have to draw their consequences going forward. 

A fun structure imo.

It's also neatly mirrored/inversed in Eclipse where the better part of the book focuses on vampire-business until the ending is suddenly heavily focused on Bella and Jacob's relationship.

u96u98,Just finished reading New Moon for the first time as an adult.,i5rwh0p,2022-04-22 17:32:47,"That's definitely an understandable reason to like it less. 

To enjoy New Moon and Eclipse one has to have somewhat of a sympathy for Jacob and see a possibility of him and Bella being together. If that's out of the question then the whole trilogy just falls flat. 

As it's written, Bella _did_ grow to romantically love Jacob and deluded herself into continuing to see him as ""just a friend"" (while essentially treating him like a second boyfriend) because she wasn't ready to choose between him and Edward, causing pain to all three of them. 

Eclipse heavily weighs in on that conflict, especially at the end where the whole thing is resolved and Bella faces some painful realizations about her actions, showing growth by drawing the necessary consequences. 

Breaking Dawn is a completely different thing altogether since imo the plot of Forever Dawn is just wholly and fundamentally incompatible with the developments of Eclipse but that's a whole separate can of worms.

As far as the initial trilogy is concerned though, it definitely hinges on the emotional conflict that New Moon created. 

But yeah I can see how that wouldn't work when you never really saw Bella and Jacob as a possibility in the first place.",Slashycent
u96u98,Just finished reading New Moon for the first time as an adult.,i61fwfi,2022-04-24 19:49:20,"Glad my take resonated with you. :)

Adding to your last point I've definitely noticed somewhat of a disparity in the fandom between those who just clung to Edward and the vampires as the main focus of the series and those who were open for Jacob, the wolves and Bella's conflict between those two worlds. 

The latter have a much better time with New Moon and Eclipse than the former, where quite a few of them would prefer to downright _skip_ the two and go straight from Twilight to Forever/Breaking Dawn. 

It's almost like the fandom took the tribal conflict from the series into reality. 

Gives the whole ""Team Edward vs Team Jacob"" thing a much more meta meaning. 

I for one am decisively part of the New Moon/Eclipse camp.

That's just where the heart of the story lies to me. 

Twilight was nice but it was New Moon that truly _hooked_ me, and after its main conflict was subsequently resolved in Eclipse I honestly felt like the whole thing could've just ended. 

And I'm ultimately ""Team Edward"" no less. 

Just an interesting dynamic all in all.",Slashycent

u96u98,Just finished reading New Moon for the first time as an adult.,i5sj2k9,2022-04-22 20:03:50,"Yes. I've been getting back into the series as an adult, though I never fully left it. 

I remember hating Eclipse the first time around because I was/am firmly Team Edward, and the love triangle stuff made me feel so bad for him and angry at Bella (though obviously his controlling/lying behavior in the first part of the book is reprehensible). I hate seeing things that should be so purely happy and romantic like choosing to wear an engagement ring be tainted by this looming other-man. Not that I even hate Jacob, sexual assault and emotional manipulation scenes aside (I choose to mostly ignore those scenes or else my brain would break). 

Then I went back and read certain parts again, and I was struck by how sweet they are -- the leg-hitch scene, the proposal scene, some of E and B's normal-ish conversations about their future and random stuff. It made me realize that we never got to really see E and B's actual relationship until Eclipse. Twilight was basically all about them getting together and him trying not to kill her. The moment they actually get ""together,"" they're torn apart. Then he's gone almost all of New Moon, and while I adore the reunion scene, that's not a normal relationship slice of life either. This makes it all the sweeter to see them communicate and support each other in Eclipse like a ""normal"" couple would. The whole compromise thing is a great way of showing how they've grown, not only within the book but over the whole series. Edward has learned, after his huge f-up in NM and his controlling behavior early in Eclipse, to stop making unilateral decisions and to instead level with Bella as a partner. Bella, for her part, has learned not to revolve her ENTIRE life around Edward. She still does some stupid stuff like the third wife thing, but she generally seems to have a shred of self-worth and self-preservation. It's touching to see how this allows them to work together to make decisions that suits them both and to somewhat assuage E's guilt about changing her into a vamp. And while I don't agree with how it was handled overall, it's good to see her finally lay the love triangle to rest at the end of Eclipse. 

Then BD hits, and all that growth goes out the window. The second they discover the pregnancy, Edward is back to making unilateral decisions for the two of them, or trying to anyway. The honeymoon sequence is a foreshadow of this of course, him withholding something they both want, sex, out of a ""misguided"" concern for her safety (... but also sex should \*not\* hurt (unless you want it to, which isn't what Bella says), and it's weird to see the message of a man just not quite being able to control himself enough to not hurt a woman be sanitized). I understand that his Part 2 willingness to go against her explicit will is meant to show how completely deranged and desperate he is. But that doesn't work when it's the direct opposite of everything the series had been building up to at that point, and I draw the line at violating your wife's bodily autonomy (threatening to knock her out against her will, making deals behind her back for Jake to fuck her is disgusting on so many levels). Bella, for her part, is also a complete dumbass and effectively does the equivalent of pitching herself off a cliff just to hear his voice all over again (keeping a fetus that's actively killing her, which would kill Edward in turn). Even Jacob is back humping her leg because she apparently still doesn't understand how to cut him out. The idea of her husband sitting next to her while she begs to see Jacob is so gross to me. It just renders all of NM and Eclipse so entirely useless.",Bthrowawaybeeee

Why didn’t Edward break up with her in her house or in her car? My head canon is that he knew she wouldn’t want to go back to the breakup spot because it would be painful, so he picked the start of the woods as a safety measure, to keep her out of the woods.

And I agree it is out of character for Edward not to stick around and watch, but I think he didn’t trust himself not to intervene and try to get close to her. Like he really believed she was better off without him in her life, and by sticking around and watching, he could not resist the urge to get back to her.

Edward’s flip flopping and paternalism kept him from making committing to a concrete decision. I think the people that react badly to her because of misplaced irritation that should be directed to Edward. As far as Bella is concerned, some readers also don’t like seeing behavior from women/girls they view as pathetic. Especially now that conversation around girls that are male centered have arisen online. She pined, starved herself, and spent her nights crying over a man that callously tossed her to the side. If she had “bounced back” in some way, we’d probably see less backlash. But Bella’s introversion and loner tendencies made everything worse because she self isolates and pushed people away and continued to even when support is offered from several people. In the end, it takes another man who she falls in love, and can be emotionally dependent upon, to pull her out.

There's a massive difference between her breaking up with say Mike Newton and her breaking up with Edward. It wasn't an attractiveness thing either-it's the fact that Edward had told her for months' that there would never be anyone else for him. She'd been told on a supernatural level that they were soulmates. That his entire life was dedicated to her "" you are my life now "" and if she died that he would die with her because he couldn't live in a world without her. In that breakup he'd basically erased everything he'd ever told her ( you're not right for me, you don't belong in our world, and that he didn't want her  all things that she'd been so sure she'd never have to worry about with him. It's shocking. It was traumatic to her because she was so blindsided and only knew something was up right before they left. Plus he didn't allow Alice to say goodbye and up until that point Bella had been very close to Alice so he also robbed her of that connection.)

Was it a big reaction? Yeah, but frankly justified.

Only thing I fault her for is when Jessica went to the movies with her. Jessica was terrified when the bikers were noticing that Bella was focusing on them and begged her to turn the other way, but Bella was following the ghost of Edward and put herself and Jessica in big danger.

Hate. No. Annoyed with some reckless teenage shit? Yeah but as a teenager I was pretty risk-averse.

Even though I never went through it, I had seen my friends absolutely get crushed and dumped. I had absolutely seen my friends get used. So her reaction to Edward leaving didn't surprise me TBH. I've also seen love triangles IRL in my teenage years. So the series really kind of rings true to me in these respects honestly. Peak teenager romance honestly.

Like for a lot of teenagers and even grown people, they become their relationships. Their relationship becomes their identity. Its such a thing sold to young girls and women, even now. Doing so much of the emotional lifting and whatnot. No I didn't have the words back then to describe it, now I do. I'm not going to say it was an expectation like it was that deep, but it was definitely normalized behavior and not surprising, maybe even lauded if girls simply threw themselves head first into their relationship and simply became all about it. It was like both lauded and slightly criticized but in if anyone criticizes it they're jealous and don't get it kind of undertones. Because it was all the single girls who thought she was changing too much but they couldn't possibly understand what it was like. As if a teenager needed to simulation what it was like to be a busy mother and grown woman in her teenage years, consumed with running homelife and having a profession. So implicitly I understood what I was watching/reading because I saw it IRL. And when you loose that relationship, you loose your identity basically. Imagine having an identity crisis as a teen. Shocker. I know.

I think having grown up now, looking back, you can understand the groundwork that was laid for her to have developed this really unhealthy emotional attachment. Like if a therapist or psychologist diagnosed her, she's probably have some kind of attachment disorder IMO. And as an adult, understand child psychology more and generally psychology and these concepts, which we didn't have hanging around in the popular or general public's lexicon in the early 2000s TBH, I can see how her childhood absolutely creates the foundation for this to happen to her. But side note, even without that emotional foundation from her childhood, you can still get these all consuming romances with young people and teens. They could come from the most stable and supportive household and still simply get wrapped up in their relationship because teenagers can be balls too the wall, 100% all in the deep end. Peak teenagedom IMO.

I think Eclipse annoyed me more than New Moon, but looking back I think that's because I've realized I don't have a lot of patience of miscommunication based interpersonal drama. And that's a lot of what Eclipse was based on, teenagers figuring it out. These books were highly emotional books and there's a reason why I don't watch traditional deep and heavy emotional dramas on TV. Too much of the feels are accessed and I don't want my feels touched like that. Very uncomfortable for me. It was frustrating watching Edward and Jacob spiral into this weird and uncomfortable fued. Looking back, obviously I have the language and understanding to get it. I understand its dealing with the aftermath of New Moon. And in New Moon Bella was exceptionally vulnerable and it was something wasn't really understood by any of the characters, not even Bella herself. And now I have to language to understand why it made me uncomfortable.",BloodyWritingBunny

I mean we obviously don't want girls that young becoming dependent on a boyfriend.  Edward is obviously the center of Bella's whole world. It is very unhealthy if we are talking about real life. But let's face it Twilight is a paranormal work of fiction and if we're going to suspend our disbelief for other aspects of it we have to recognize that Bella's attachment to Edward is a part of the paranormal. This is why Bella needs Edward and can't get over him. Given this her reaction is in line with the plot. 

The problem comes when young girls don't understand the difference between Twilight and real life. In real life a boyfriend like Edward is raising a whole host of red flags. If you have a guy in real life who is sneaking into your bedroom  and following you wherever you go we easily call that guy a stalker. If he is taking your truck apart so you can't go places or having his sister hold you hostage this is not romance and you'd better find a way to get away from him. This is why I don't get very upset at Jacob for kissing Bella against her will. Compared to what Edward does it's nothing.

In Twilight she had many redeemable qualities. She loved her parents, made a sacrifice to go to a city she hates and live with a father she was not close to, just to give her mom space. She chose to make the same sacrifice later but with higher stakes as she willingly surrendered her life to save her mom. 
She was polite and kept to herself, orderly and diplomatic. She thought of her friends’ happiness like making sure Mike chose Jessica to go to the prom with instead of focusing on her. 
She was not bad, really.

Even if she’d be okay after the break up, she has SO much trauma from James. He literally tortured her and tried to kill her. Now the ONLY group of people who could protect her are gone, ofc that would trigger shit in her even though James is dead. It wasn’t just losing her bf, but his family (who had become like family to her), her best friend (Alice) and her protectors. The break up really isn’t *that* far off from all the James stuff, it hadn’t even been a year. 

I also personally go back to Twilight when Edward says “everything about him drawls her in” and how that makes him the most dangerous predator. I headcanon that she probably did feel some kind of withdrawal from him because of that predatory drawl. Most of it was heartbreak but I can also see part of it being close to withdrawal symptoms.",katiebirddd_

Bella points out in New Moon (in the books this is when Alice came back and Charlie and Alice were speaking in the kitchen and Bella was “sleeping” on the couch) she says something along the lines of “it wasn’t that I just lost The love of my life, which is enough to kill anyone. But I also lost a family, a whole world that I thought I was going to be apart of” and she’s completely right. It wasn’t just some boy that she met and broke her heart. He was a super natural being that opened up her mind/world and showed her things that she didn’t even know existed. A world that most people don’t know exists. He also had this stable family with a mom and a dad and siblings (something she never had), his family loved and accepted her. And not to mention they loved each other deeply and completely. Of course she went off the rails. She probably almost could have gotten to the place (later in life if Edward never returned and if Jacob wasn’t a thing) of feeling like did I imagine it all? Especially since she couldn’t discuss it with anyone without her being committed lol. So idk why people think she’s being overly dramatic. She was right on and she was also doing her best! lol",jessguest

Upon finding out about Alice’s vision, she saw joining the Cullen’s as the inevitable outcome. A matter of when, not if she’d become a vampire. When the Cullen’s left, they ripped her future a part. She knew she had no way of finding them if they didn’t want to be found and no way of being a vampire without them. Even if she managed to cross paths with another vampire, they likely would have killed her. Add to that, she really couldn’t tell people why the Cullen’s leaving hurt so much. To everyone else, it was a typical HS romance that likely wasn’t going to last forever. She couldn’t tell them that she planned on spending eternity with the Cullen’s as the newest member of their vampire coven. Also, Edward was quite brutal with how he dumped her, playing on her insecurities that she wasn’t worthy of him. In fairness, she was probably on the verge of a psychotic break and borderline suicidal throughout New Moon. She was actively having hallucinations that were evoked during dangerous and stressful events after all.",soccerdevil22

He is literal perfection to her (rich, physically attractive, strong, talented, smart) and without any warning leaves her and so does her best friend Alice. 

I find book Bella annoying with how patient she is about learning about Edward when she finds out he’s a vampire. Like girl, I’d have a million questions for him but she just so nonchalant about it. She’s also so against receiving help from Edward. It’s just unrealistic to me and annoying.

Not including her childhood that some have brought up. Just from the movies, James literally started to hunt her down in the first movie. She had to leave her family and go on the run from a monster literally hunting her for sport. 

James also pretended to kidnap her mother to get her to escape from her protection and then kill her. She went into the ballet studio thinking she would die in place of her mother. She was thrown around and had her leg broken while being recorded by a monster to make Edward angry so James could fight him, She almost died, via turning then blood loss from Edward feeding from her. 

The only reason she wasn't freaking out before Edward left her was because he likely slept with her, he was the person who saved her and also almost killed her. He and his family was the defensive line between her and Laurent and Victoria part of James' coven. People are still being killed, and Bella has to think either James' coven  or some other monster is in the area. Not some killer or just an animal. Bella is likely scared on top of being abandoned by this guy who gave her this glimpse into what she has always wanted. 

Let alone nightmares of being tortured and almost dying, Bella has to be terrified. This first part in her mind of stability and freedom has been ripped from her. She has to be out of her mind, she literally hallucinated Edward. Her behaviours are not only due to loosing Edward. 

She is in danger, was almost killed and tortured and can't tell anyone about it. And the first glimpse of a dream life to her was ripped away. She literally told Edward in Eclipse that "" This wasn't a choice between you and Jacob. This was a choice between who I should be and who I am. I've always felt out of step, literally stumbling through my life. I've never felt normal. I don't wanna be. I've faced death, and loss, and pain in your world, but I've also never felt stronger... like more real, more myself. Because it's my world too."". She lost who she felt she was. This missing puzzle piece in her view of her life. She felt like even if she was attacked she finally found that missing part / parts of herself that made her complete. She was suffering PTSD and then lost that part of herself that made her feel whole. She lost her protector, her found family, her partner and herself. She has cause to be wrecked, devastated even let alone grieving her loss. She has cause to have nightmares and be acting out wildly. And let alone all of the stuff with James happening mid march then Edward leaves in September. Just under 6 months.

She uses people to get what she wants, to try and avoid the pain she feels. She openly admits this to the reader frequently. Just like she used Jacob at the beginning of Twilight to learn more about Edward, she uses Jessica, Mike, and Jacob, and even manipulates the truth with Charlie to get her way and to make herself feel better. She doesn't even seem to like some of these people, she truly just uses them, which is one reason why she's a bad friend and therefore  unlikable to the reader. 

It's like she has almost no empathy at all for other people sometimes. She can be very judgemental and reactive too, slamming doors and making snarky comments (without humor). And I imagine she doesn't have a great track record with friendships in the past because she says her mom is her best friend, which is probably codependent and unhealthy. Just because teenagers sometimes act like jerks doesn't make it acceptable. It's still unfriendly and ""unattractive behavior,"" if you will. 

Yes, I know she's depressed and antisocial because of her depression, but even when she was getting better and enjoying life again, she acts and thinks about herself without ever apologizing for her bad behavior or sacrificing her happiness in any way for others.

The pain she's causing Jacob by being assaulted by him after spending two books telling him and showing him that she wants Edward I guess. 

I've just finished rereading the whole series, and she's hard going at times in Eclipse and the start of Breaking Dawn. I think it is made worse because Jacob is being painted as the victim, when his actions are inexcusable. It's actually impressive writing that his pov chapters redeem him a little into a semi likable character, just in time for him to imprint on a newborn.

Edward encouraged and engaged in this unhealthy dynamic with her, and their relationship was symbiotic in a way so it’s not shocking that the loss of him was very detrimental to her overall health and happiness. 

She then switches her attachment to Jacob, who is more healthy than Edward imo (in Twilight and New Moon Jacob was very sweet and a much better option, until SM obliterated his character later on) but she’s still co dependant with Jake. Which in the end is unfair on him, and she knows it and he knows it but accepts the treatment because he adores her so much.

When people hate on her due to her reaction to the breakup and her co dependency with Edward & Jacob, I just think they are simply ignorant and their anger is misplaced- I do understand it was frustrating to read her inner monologue where she was looking at it all through rose coloured glasses (I wanted to shake her and tell her to focus on herself and leave Edward!), but she was a vulnerable, isolated teenage girl who didn’t have anyone really looking out for her.

Bella was a bad friend though kinda. She wasn’t even really a friend to any of them, bar Angela, Bella was a fair weathered friend and didn’t allow people to truly know her. Even before she planned out her future as a vampire and pushed people away so it wouldn’t be as painful to lose them when she was a vampire, she was very surface level with them and didn’t truly befriend them. If nobody tried to befriend her I bet she’d have just stayed alone and not tried to befriend anyone, because she just seemed to not care for friendship. 

When people call the Forks teens (Mike, Jess, Ben etc) evil for not being there for Bella in her depression it annoys me, because Bella didn’t allow them to have any emotional connection with her prior to her depression, so even if they did try to help her I’m sure she will have pushed them away entirely, and she kinda did tbh.

She wasn’t perfect, but I think she was a regular teenage girl and the insane hate against her is kinda silly.",salvatore067892

New Moon was when I disliked her most. Not even for the depression thing, I can kinda understand that. But she was quick to distance herself from her friends because of the Cullens. She became too dependent on them and wasn’t her own person. So when they left, she found herself in the aftermath of her own decisions, where there was no one to help her.

I also don’t like how she unhealthily latched on to Jacob, acknowledging that she was leading him on but continuing to do so because she was afraid he’d leave her. I get that she didn’t want to fall into that depression again, but she was quick to drop him the second the Cullens showed back up, not really being as persistent as she could’ve been in restoring their friendship as she seemed to want. 

I don’t know. I understand that at the end of the day, she was a 17 year old girl, but given the way she grew up, it didn’t make sense for her to go from this self proclaimed “middle age adult” to this  simpering girl who’d do anything and cut off anyone for some guy within the span of a couple days. I just feel like realistically, it would’ve taken her at least some months or years before her “mature” personality was compromised.

The entire thing about making her a vampire is another way she treats Edward so poorly. He is over here worried about her soul, and she knows that for a fact, but plays the “you just don’t want to spend an eternity with me” bull crap. She is very manipulative towards Edward and Jacob. She is made to be mature and beyond her years, but she isn’t. Just because she isn’t a gossip queen like Jessica does not mean she is mature.

It brainwashes young teens. Instead of suicide, they should have depicted Edward as being depressed if Bella had died. Contemplating suicide at a young age was a big thing for me as I struggled with undiagnosed depression and anxiety. My relationship was a long-distance relationship for many years, just like you. It put me in a dark place for years as our relationship was very toxic. But the idea of living without him made me consider that opinion, and I'm very sure that Twilight influenced that idea.

The other thing that really bothered me is Bella just accepted him back in her life without even getting mad or defending herself. That was a really messed up thing Edward did, and she just forgives him?? That's basically teaching young girls that in order to be desirable to a guy, they have to be submissive and not stand up for themselves.

I saw Twilight as perfect as a kid, but the older I get, the more red flags I see. It's absolutely atrocious. 🙄🙄

People go through tragic breakups all the time, and deal with emotional pain regularly. I’m not the kind of person who will believe her love is so much stronger or special than anyone else’s, and people get over breakups and divorce every day. They grieve, they emotionally disconnect for a little while, then they pick themselves up and move on. Bella took it to the furthest extreme, but there are a few who do in every day life also. The only way it could have been worse would have been if she actually did jump off the cliff in an attempt to commit suicide, but that could also be an opinion. Some would say chasing hallucinations is worse. Yes Edward went about things in a very shitty way, but her response was also too much, and she actually got very lucky that Sam was a wolf and was able to find her, cuz girl went and got herself lost and could have died in those woods. 

People also say Edward is very dramatic, with his constant kill me if she dies way of thinking. He literally does try to off himself. But for vampires it makes sense because they are like penguins, they mate for life. Once they find their mate it is forever. The best case argument for Bella I would say is the fact that she is in a relationship with a vampire so it changes things a little, and she also even as a human has a supernatural ability, so she is more attuned to the vampires’ ways in some sense. Kinda like how she says she was born to be a vampire, and the way she explains “it wasn’t a fight between you and Jacob, it was between who I should be and who I am.” But I still think it was a bit much. 😂",Just-Messin

In my experience of life, a lot of the women trying desperately to be ""strong"" actually have trauma they never took the time to work through, because they weren't given space and time to grieve.

I think in many ways Twilight is just not well suited to being anything but a book.

The theory is basically that if a majority of the storytelling is happening inside the narrator's head, the story is probably better as a book. If the majority of the story is told through action and interaction, the story would work well as a movie. 

Think about it, I literally have no idea how you would depict book Bella accurately in a movie. So much of the books are just pages and pages of Bella stewing internally about the situations she's in. This gives us a wonderful rich picture of who she is as a person and how she feels about her circumstances, but I don't see how you could put all that in a movie without having voice over narration on the whole thing. They utilized Bella's voice over a little in the movies, but you can't put narration over an entire film. The result is a much more bland Bella than we got in the books, and I think any actress would have felt bland for this reason.

Compare this to a book like Harry Potter. We do hear Harry's internal thoughts sometimes, but they are not nearly as important to the narrative as the action that is going on, for the most part. Harry's thoughts are given to the reader through his conversations with other characters more often than they're given through his internal monologuing. I think this is why especially the first movie is known for being very accurate to the book. It was well suited for a movie adaptation in the first place.",bluegirlrosee

That is completely unhinged behavior. Full stop.

And she only started to get better when she fell in love with another man, so her entire world is contingent on male validation. She has no goals or desires for herself outside of that even before she moved to Fork which is very… idk how else to say but, empty for a whole ass person (I get the magical vampire goal becomes her dream but keep in mind the timeline of the entire series is quite literally a fricking year and a half (Edward gone for half that too lmao) so it’s also completely insane to go from high school junior just-moved-to-town to married, pregnant, AND making the decision to DIE to be with your high school boyfriend [seems like this was possibly her first and. only relationship ever too besides the messy Jacob situationship] by the summer after senior year). 

And in terms of the Edward/Bella relationship ummm they basically talked like twice before the meadow where they decide they’re madly in love and she’s fine risking her life to date him.

Only living for your man IS pathetic. 

My issue is you saying this needs to happen in 1-2 weeks or you're pathetic. That's imposing a timetable on grief. So that's the real-life piece to it. The other piece is the exaggerated ""fated lovers"" blown out of all proportion swoony hyper reality that Twilight is dolloping scoops on.

I don't justify any of Bella's other behaviour. I don't think Bella is a ""pick me"" at all in-universe, but speaking in ""extra textual"" terms, the author definitely wrote her as one (if that makes sense). Her post-break up depression is written deliberately in this way to give the reader a very particular vicarious pleasure : to revel in a particular side to femininity, an uber ""romantic"" overindulgent emo teenage type of thing that is a delicious guilty pleasure to read for a lot of girls/women.

Being so deeply in love that it's way outside of the normal, this is a love for the ages! lol of course it's not realistic, she's not going to therapy, she's not even acting like a normal teenage girl after a breakup. She is aligned in the reader's mind with Cathy from Wuthering Heights, or Juliet - not some normie who deals with their epic romance in a rational way.  It's not modelling healthy post-breakup behaviour or good treatment of herself and those who care about her, we agree there.

To be fair, her English degree that was largely based on Shakespearean literature (since she over romanticized “the *tragedy* of Romeo & Juliet”) did come from Brigham Young University, so I suppose it makes sense that her toxic upbringing was kept consistent with a toxic religious education.

I intend on earning a creative writing BA degree and minoring in classical and medieval studies at PDX/PSU, when I can afford to move from California to Oregon in half a decade from now.

When I was 20 I had a really hard breakup with somebody I wasn't even dating (I think that's what people call a situationship). So when it happened, nobody even knew I was ""seeing"" someone. But it was one of the hardest thing I ever experienced (after months of not leaving my bed for anything but school I was finally diagnosed with depression, so yeah it was pretty bad).

My familly was awful about it. Basically everything your quote says. I'm a grown woman, no man is worth being in depression, I should be strong and I'm dumb for letting myself get so sad about it. That's when I understood that ""heartbreak"" is truly something that you *have* to experience to understand how awful it is. It doesn't matter the age and gender, the circonstances, or even the person you're having a heartbreak over. Edward could be the blandest type of buttered pasta loving human for that matter, Bella's suffering would still be valid. (but yeah him being a vampire added another layer of trauma for sure)

Did my situationship was ""worth"" me being depressed for months and still waiting for him years after that? Of course not! But heartbreak is not a logical thing. It destroys you fr. I feel like it kinda rewrote my brain chemistry for how much I saw the world differently before and after it happened lol, it's hard to explain. And being shamed by my family and ""Bella is a dumb bitch for mourning her vampire that dramatically"" type of people is something that is still very painful to this day. (even recently my older brother reminded me of how annoyed he was I ruined my OWN 21st birthday over it (because I left mid-dinner to go cry)) Btw I'm just using your quote as a reference (because I heard it so often) but I'm not saying you're one of the people I'm talking about of course! Before I experience a heartbreak myself I thought Bella's reaction was sooo over the top and sooo exagerated too! But then I experienced it and was like, ""Oh... Oh I get it now"" lol.

Edward: “Everything about me invites you in. My voice. My face. Even my smell.” (I know the quote is from the movie, but idk about the book. I just purchased my first copies and they’re out for delivery right now 😅)

Genuinely, I think Bella is not just in love with Edward, but she is actively under this sort of hypnotic vampire spell where she physically and mentally cannot keep herself away from him. Twilight vampires are kind of designed like Venus flytraps or angler fish, where they lure their victims in with their stunning beauty and other attributes before striking - if they’re not outright hunting. I’m not saying Edward doesn’t love her back, but I am saying the power dynamic is not weighing in her favor at all.

I think Bella’s depression is not just a side effect of heartbreak and dealing with the weight of this huge secret on her conscience, but it’s also a byproduct equivalent to cutting an addict off of their source cold turkey. She looks like she’s experiencing intense withdrawal, and it only just starts to get better when she starts accepting Jacob’s presence and affections (IIRC from watching New Moon).

So, to be fair, Jacob did have a point in saying it would have been better if Edward stayed away (Eclipse?). She would have been able to come down from the Cullen’s influence and maybe have become her own person after a while - possibly a few years.

I don’t think I had that phase you had in your 20s ever. 

Like when I was younger and reading the books, I saw it as a really bad break up. And just a break up. Like we all seen people completely crash when they get dumped. Complete blindside dumping and it’s rough.

But as I’ve grown up and engaged more in analysis of twilight and the layered and deeper nuances within it, this whole psychological and traumatic aspect, really make it make much more sense. Like as a child, I never considered how these things traumatized her. I think part of is also because, I was really speed reading through some of the books to get to the next book. Like the same thing happened to me with Harry Potter and book 5. I didn’t have a strong opinion of book 5 but I learned a lot of people hated it and then they felt bad because they grew up and realized JK Rowling was writing about trauma and depression. And I didn’t realize that when I was reading Harry Potter, too, that it was about trauma and depression.

I remember when I was younger the first time I came across this concept that Bella was depressed and traumatized was the discussion of Stephanie Myers handling of certain chapters where she just put the months passing by.

1g3aus5,Rewatching new moon and coming back around to Bella’s depression. It totally makes sense. ,lrzh6k0,2024-10-15 03:19:40,"Have you read Midnight Sun? Because Edward actually decides to leave when Bella is still comatose in the hospital. He’s not even thinking about Victoria, he’s only thinking about the damage done by James that occurred singularly because of his (Edward’s) presence in Bella’s life. He forced himself to stay until she was physically healed before leaving. So this situation could’ve been 10x shittier. Imagine facing down a vampire, being saved by your boyfriend only to wake up in the hospital alone and probably thinking you’ll never see him again? Edward would’ve been an S tier jerk.

As for Victoria, I used to think this was like a “He left because Victoria was after him” thing. However after reading Midnight Sun, I don’t think that’s the case anymore. As others have said, Edward never heard or saw or sensed strong affection between Victoria and James. I don’t think their situation was anywhere in the realm of normal. So Edward didn’t expect a typical revenge response. 

Then there’s Alice. Problem being is Victoria first needed to find out James was dead. We don’t know how long that took because in Midnight Sun last we know is Victoria jumped into the water by Forks. Now this next part is partially my own theory. Victoria would’ve adjusted however that looked for her (grieving, depression, etc) and then started considering revenge. However we know Victoria’s gift is self preservation. So she probably would have opted to be patient. Even if Alice was watching Victoria’s decisions, Victoria wouldn’t have decided anything. Victoria would just be waiting.

Between the unusual nature of James and Victoria’s relationship and Victoria’s gift of super self preservation - anticipating her movements would’ve been nearly impossible until too late.

So to Edward, he didn’t leave her unprotected. To him, he left her safer than she would be with him. Especially since he’d go looking for Victoria to prevent issue there.

She intentionally leads him to varying degrees on because he makes her feel good again. This isn't in the films but Bella's internal monologue isn't subtle about how she's using him.

Jacob only really becomes an actively shitty person in Eclipse, which drops their old dynamic for a new one where he actually is just the guy who refuses to take a hint until he eventually sexually assaults her.

If sequel movies and reboots are cash grabs, this would be too. Doesn’t mean it can’t ALSO be a good and interesting story but it still feels like a cash grab. If she’s such a beloved author, write novel stories and her audience will follow. No hate, just stating an opinion that it appears to be a cash grab, which doesn’t affect my interest in possibly reading it. Arguably anniversary editions and re-releases of books are crash grabs as well because it’s just yet another version of an already successful and profitable story, but I am capable of not holding mutually exclusive opinions and might still find those kinds of works enjoyable on plenty of occasions.",TruGamingBlonde

Midnight Sun is a lot of work to write. It's not just a POV swap. Edward's position means Stephanie both had to handle his powers and write his story in a way that still leaves him as a character the audience will like and root for. It also is just broadly a better written book than the original Twilight and the audience of Twilight was pestering Stephanie to write it for years. The only reason it took so long was the leaks killed her desire to keep writing it.

Life and Death isn't a cash grab either. It's Stephanie responding to critics who were calling her a sexist because of Bella being a bit of a damsel in distress. It also wasn't properly advertised either and the community as a whole were not asking for it.",SleepyandEnglish

If money weren’t a factor, she could write completely different stories with characters nobody has heard of yet and no care if people enjoy them. I feel like you’re taking the label cash grab very personally and you’re assuming it can only ever be extreme in cases like Star Wars. A star is born is considered a cash grab by some because it wasn’t the first time that movie has been done, in fact 3 movies with the same title and idea precede the Lady Gaga version. But that doesn’t make the movie a bad movie or even that is shouldn’t have been made. Cash grab doesn’t have to be incredibly insulting if it’s not being said in a derogatory manner. Just like some people use weird as an insult and others take it as a compliment. You are assuming I mean the worst by calling it a cash grab and arguing in defense of it without actually refuting the arguments I’ve mentioned. Twilight was incredibly successful, midnight sun was guaranteed money and life and death was too just by being connected thematically to Twilight. Ergo cash grab, regardless of whether the author needs the money, regardless of how much easier (or not) it is to accomplish. The idea here is she was guaranteed money by writing both of these books, there was little to no risk. New ideas are everywhere but they are risky too and might be bad when we’re finished because that’s life!

He had an obvious crush on Bella, but from reading MS, we see that he’s like “aww ok then” when he realizes she’s with Edward. He still likes Bella, but respects that she has a bf regardless of his father’s prejudice towards him. By NM, he seemed kinda okay in the beginning, but it was clear he was getting impatient with trying to “help” Bella move on. He kept subtly trying to hit on her and push her to see him as an option. It only got worse after he changed. His desire for Bella was fueling his hatred of vampires and it was exhausting that he couldn’t move on from her (I refuse to acknowledge some “pull” he had to her simply because she was carrying an egg that would eventually be his imprint 😒). Obviously Eclipse showed him at his peak shittiness. What small bit of hope I had vanished after that. 

Overall, Jacob was selfish as hell. Regardless of what he felt for Bella, he should’ve learned from Leah’s situation. Why the hell would you still want to start a family with this person when you know there’s always gonna be a possibility, no matter how small, that you’re gonna imprint on someone else. Especially when she knows about imprinting! Like I could see it being different if she didn’t know. You could claim blissful ignorance and pretend that person is your soulmate because they’d never know otherwise. But Bella knows about imprinting and he was just expecting her to be okay with the fact that he could leave her at any moment for someone who’s his literal soulmate.

That said this situation is often glossed over because it’s not uncommon for someone to take a chance when they believe feelings are mutual. The outcome can vary because the recipient may welcome the kiss, or they may find it unwelcome.

Many movies and TV shows depict similar scenarios where a character misreads signals and acts on their assumptions, often presenting them as romantic rather than inappropriate.

The last screenshot is 200 pages later somewhere in the woods based on the “It was quiet then for a while; there was just the sound of his measured breathing and the wind roaring high above us in the tree-tops. A cliff face rose sheer beside us, bare, rough gray stone.“ 

So, Charlie didn’t have any of that dialogue as context. Additionally, her hand wasn’t confirmed as broken until after she left her house with Edward and Carlisle x-rayed her. Meaning Charlie didn’t have that full context either. In fairness, I’m sure he didn’t even think it was possible to punch someone and leave no marks on them but break your own hand.

If Bella waits until she’s 24, sure, she’ll have a bunch of experiences that she won’t get as a Vampire, but she’ll also be 24 to Edwards 17, and getting some serious side-eye whenever they’re out in public. The older you are, the harder it is to pass for younger. I wouldn’t want to have to claim to be my husband’s aunt in public, either.

Additionally, the Volturi have them on a time limit.
The Newborn army resulted in a check in less than a year after they met Bella, but how long would they realistically wait before “requesting” to met the new member of the coven?

What would the consequences be if Edward and Bella, or all of the Cullens, pulled a disappearing act?

Step one: the Volturi wipe Forks off the map, just in case Bella shared the knowledge. They find the Quilute tribe, and kill them, too, as an obvious threat.

Step Two: Keep tracking the Cullens, and killing everyone they interacted with, until the Cullens stop playing hide and seek",WhyAmIStillHere86

I see it as a fundamental awakening. I see it as a *life changing* event. Something so profound that you can never see the world as it used to be again. I see them as soulmates. I read a lot of romances and soulmates pop up a lot and they’re not like normal people. Nothing about soulmate is rational. A spiritual awakening is like the closest real-life thing I can think of. That or near death experiences. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not that religious, but we’ve heard the stories (at least I have). Someone is doing what they’re doing as they always been doing it and then BAM! God came down upon them and opened their eyes and completely changed them - fundamentally. They saw the world as everyone does but then BAM! They realize they weren’t seeing the world until this experience, this feeling, came upon them and they saw the truth of the world. They could see colors brighter, found a meaning for their existence. Or a near death experience - you think you’re going to die, you are dying, maybe you even did die and you wake up with a new purpose to life- you changed in your core of your being. (Obviously not saying everyone with a near death experience has this feeling, nor anyone who finds religion, but some people do come out of those experiences fundamentally changed). 

Bella was living her life and it was fine but then BAM suddenly everything changed. The world changed. She wasn’t just existing - she was *living*. It’s like how Jake explained imprints but for Edward and Bella it was more subtle (though obviously their relationship was fast paced). “Imprinting on someone is like when you see her, everything changes. All of a sudden it's not gravity holding you the planet, it's her. Nothing else matters.” If I found something like that, something that changed me fundamentally as a person, not even talking romantically here, I’d never want to let it go. I can’t image something changing how I see the world, changing how I function, changing how I see colors and experience life. I can’t fault Bella at all for wanting to become a vampire as soon as she could. She knew how finicky Edward is about changing her, and she also knew that her number was up. She’d been running from death since that first meeting in Forks. I wouldn’t have wanted to wait for the next life threatening disaster either - and keep in mind Bella *did* agree to go to college human and wait a little longer and guess what?! She got pregnant by a hybrid offspring that *broke her spine* and nearly killed her (again)! I can’t blame Bella at for wanting to change as soon as possible - nor for wanting to stay on USA soil.

It was just like her cliff diving - alone and emotionally manipulating Jake, who she knew cared for her. Jake was more mature than Bella, and he was YOUNGER. Bella desperately NEEDED those 4-5 years just to mature past her childishness and learn that she didn't always get her way. I honestly think all of her escapades with Jake were to force Alice into a vision and come running back, which is what happe ed just in a worse way.

My 13-year-old daughter didn't even finish New Moon. She went on a tirade about Bella being the weakest female she'd ever read - she'd just finished Hunger Games.

1jwprux,Very mad about Jacob’s post-New Moon portrayal today,mmmjqmg,2025-04-11 20:39:35,"I think people don't take into consideration the change Jacob goes through in New Moon enough. Stories that he thought were baloney all end up being real. He is now a mythical creature tasked with protecting his people from vampires. Vampires that the girl he sees as his best friend and potential mate is in love with and wants to become one of. He watches the other members of his pack tied heart and soul to women who they before had no interest in, one a baby and one the cousin of the girl he started out being in love with. Add to that he can now hear the thoughts of all these other guys. All their shameful thoughts and depressing thoughts. Their family squabbles, and family secrets. 

On top of that he's growing by the minute. 

He's under the impression that his only reason for existing is to save humans from vampires and this one girl is willingly walking head first into becoming his sworn enemy. 

Is he supposed to be unchanged by all that? is he not supposed to feel this sense of urgency and impending doom? The way he goes about it is all wrong, but how at 16 is he supposed to know and understand what is the right thing to do when no one in the history of ever has been in the same situation? 

I've also kind of always thought that Jacob's change is supposed to highlight Edward's unchangingness. If Jacob is perfect throughout the books and does nothing wrong, how are we supposed to feel when Bella chooses Edward? She is sure of her course because Edward is always going to love her. Jacob is one minute a raging jerk, the next her warm sunshine. She is never sure which Jacob is going to get.

edit: i'd also like to add that a life with a werewolf is not perfect either and we see that with emily. if he were to get angry with bella it could very easily become an abusive relationship which he shows with how mad he gets when she tells him her decisions. 

her pull to Edward was not that he was a ""cold, mysterious vampire who offers the thrill of danger and requires sacrifice"" and i kinda hate how bella's feeling of never belonging in the human world is COMPLETELY erased and watered down to "" she only wanted to become a vampire to be with edward"" that was not the case.

Jacob was a child, he was young, he was immature, and for a short time he WAS a viable option, bella even for a second imagines what her world would be with jacob. she does love him (in my opinion)

but you are kinda making up a character in your head that doesn't exist. Jacob was always pushy, he always wanted more and the older he got the more those traits came out.

1jwprux,Very mad about Jacob’s post-New Moon portrayal today,mmn52pp,2025-04-11 22:37:43,"written this post myself about 3 times. People argue that it’s totally not in his character to push her boundaries, other say it totally is. I personally think if SM played it differently Jacub from Eclipse onwards could have been a really good friend. 

He likes Bella in twilight, didn’t push any boundaries, he let her come to him in New Moon to hang out and be friends. He tries kissing her when he thinks she’d be ok with it, she doesn’t accept and he gets frustrated. this is where the representation goes to shit. 

Answering the phone at her house is insane, especially when she’s trying to get to the phone herself. He heard Alice say ‘i thought you were dead’ yet he tells the vampire on the line ‘Charlie’s at a funeral’ knowing how it sounds, he gives Charlie the bikes so that Charlie can basically ground Bella forever and she can never be happily together with her boyfriend. 

that’s when the character assassination starts. Then he pushes every conceivable boundary, assaults bella twice, once very physically, second time with emotional blackmail threatening his life. it’s completely fucked and the idea that Bella would be happy with Jake near her daughter is insane to me. 

I would literally never willingly hand off my daughter to that type of man. If Nessie doesn’t want to be with jake? wants to travel and meet the others of her breed? if she fancies someone at school and maybe wants to go on a date? imagine jake’s reaction. Absolutely not. 

I’m VERY angry at the way Jake was portrayed, becuase he was written as a hard choice for Bella to make, to have to pick between, and the choice is between Edward and a sexual assaulter.

The way I see it, the original (and true) Jacob does die in her hands and gets a new life under the name Seth. Everything she set up about Jacob, everything that makes him *him* is almost non-existent once Edward returns. And this belief is not a cop-out, a way to close my eyes on his ""problematic"" behavior to allow myself to keep being ""team Jacob"". Because I do believe Bella and Edward are soulmates and I don't think of Jacob, the character, just through the lense of being a potential partner for Bella.
At his core, the way SM presented Jacob to us initially, Jacob is not someone who is harsh, abrasive, cruel with his words, selfish in his lack of care for consent. But I don't think SM realized how much she was butchering his character in Eclipse because never does she have Bella say about Jacob that she doesn't recognize him. When realistically, she should have. Instead, both characters torture each other and really bring home how Edward is the better and only option for Bella romantically. And how their friendship now becomes impossible.

I haven't read BD in a few years but I do feel like, in the movie at least, his friendship with Bella once she's transformed gives him back to us a little bit. The real him.

I’m not and have never been team Jacob, but I think it’s a bit of a stretch to call them “racist tropes” when talking about Jacob’s development. 

It’s been a second since I read NM, but from my memory it’s like an insanely intense, hyperactive version of puberty. He’s not only dealing with his own emotions, but the emotions, actions, judgements, and perceptions of others. He went from being a kid who thought his family had a bunch of cool tall tales, and within a few months got sprung into a life he had no real choice in. ALSO… putting some of Jacob’s traits onto Seth again makes sense because Seth is younger and we’re watching Seth go thru the same thing Jacob is, but at a step-behind-pace. If we got to see Seth a year after BD happens, I would bet he’d lose some of his soft edges too.

Jacob post phasing. 
I think a lot of how he projects his butthead self is fear based. 
Phasing was so much for him to unpack. Not only is he likely to be subconsciously feeling his alpha roots, which would make him more aggressive, but his instincts at his age are focused on killing vampires, protecting the town and mating. 
He hates the thought of losing himself and imprinting on someone. 
He hates that even though Edward is gone, that he is still a rival even. 
He hates that even though he’s sure he’s better for her, Bella can’t see him as boyfriend/future wife material.

He even goes to a different rural town to reflect on how much he hates mating and feels as tho he could never take over La Push because he doesn't have the alpha claim to it that Sam has with his mate. He had alpha struggles with Sam but that was it! I thought it was fucked up Leah and Seth were the only wolves to come support him and his claim to being alpha in Breaking Dawn over his actual friends before transformation Embry and Quil.

Jacob was not aggressive towards Bella except that one time he phased while she was out running in that field. That was before she even knew what was happening and this was used by Bella multiple times against Edward's attacks. Jacob very obviously says that he doesn't care about Forks, only La Push. He even threatens the Cullens multiple times on the treaty specifics and how he doesn't gaf about Forks.

Jacob was really never a viable alternative to Edward in a meta sense because he had nothing to offer that our society considers desirable. He is poor, Native American, with a disabled father he must care for, and his werewolf brethren are portrayed as being more violent, less educated, and less restrained than the Cullens. He doesn't fit the male love interest mold, and Bella ending up with Jacob would not offer the glamorous, escapist fantasy that romance demands. Also, Bella can't gain eternal youth, beauty, or strength by coupling with Jacob.... but Edward can offer her all three by turning her.

There were things about him that didn’t make him the most perfect boyfriend in the whole world. I mean, some things about him make him an amazing boyfriend, but other things were lacking — and Jacob sort of was the alternative. Here you have Edward, someone who overthinks everything — whose every emotion is overwrought—and just tortures himself. And there’s so much angst, because he has never come to terms with what he is.

>Then here you have Jacob, someone who never gives anything a passing thought and just is happy-go-lucky: If something’s wrong, well, okay — let’s just get over it and move on. Here’s someone who’s able to take things in stride a little bit more, who doesn’t overthink everything. Someone who’s a little rash. He does seem foolish sometimes, just because he doesn’t pause to think before he leaps, you know?

>That was sort of the opposite of Edward’s character in a lot of ways. **It gave a balance to the story and a choice for Bella, because I think she needed that. There was an option for her to choose a different life, with someone that she could have loved — or someone who she does love. I always felt like that was really necessary to the story.** Because when I write, I try to make the characters react to things the way I think real people would.

>I think that, in reality, it’s never one boy — there’s never this moment when you know. There’s a choice there, and sometimes it’s hard. Romance and relationships are a tangle, and this messy thing—you never know what to expect, and people are so surprising.

You make this claim as if you know this character more then the author? You do realize he isn’t real right? Your last two sentences makes me realize that you don’t know both the motivations of SM and the characters.

SM is a bit delusional if you haven’t noticed, she doesn’t see that Jacobs behavior is abusive and wrong, she defends Jacob and makes excuses for him. She sees it as romantics but to the normal person who watches the movies or reads the books can clearly see that every character is insane and exhibits some kind of toxic behaviors. 

She writes Jacob in what she views a romantic light and then gets mad when people tell her that Jacob is abusive. 

She doesn’t think what Jacob is doing is wrong, but the reality is (something she’s not living in, reality) Jacob is abusive. This is probably why you’re confused. “If she loved her character of Jacob then why did she write him abusive?” Because to her, he isn’t abusive. He’s romantic. Young me when I watched twilight for the first time also thought of Jacob as romantic. Also, the first book/movie focuses on Bella’s relationship with Edward and her exploring Vampires. Jacob and werewolf’s weren’t explored yet/it wasn’t there time yet. 

You’re seriously mad that Jacob wasn’t ever a real option? It’s a romance between a human girl and a vampire. Not a human girl and a werewolf. It’s a love triangle, no one promised you that Bella would choose Jacob. It’s pretty clear who she was going to end up with.

Maybe that's what Meyer had in mind. 


The point is that they’re not albino. It literally doesn’t make any sense to make erase their race but leave their hair color if the reasoning is that venom kills melanin. You could make the argument that hair is dead, but so are they so it’s just doesn’t make sense.

No I’m not mad Jacob was never an option. I didn’t even want Bella to end up with him, I like him as her best friend. I’m mad Meyer botched his character. The realization I came to is she sets up the native characters to use them as props. First Jacob was created to be a plot device, plus used as the peacemaker and the native they’re friends with so people can go “see her protagonist isn’t racist” on the surface. Then when Jacob was put into the important position he was, his previous role was moved to Seth (again, so people can’t accuse Bella/Edward of blindly hating all the natives). It’s really an amazing credit to Jacob that he broke out of the 2-D cage he was born into with life and humor. But the goal of Eclipse was to get Bella to choose between becoming a vampire or staying human, not to get her to choose between Edward and Jacob, and that shows in every bit of the writing, and that’s where she botched his character",thelaurafedora

1jwprux,Very mad about Jacob’s post-New Moon portrayal today,mmutajy,2025-04-13 06:06:11,"Well honestly how I see it, I don’t think anyone should take SM writing to seriously. I mean even Stephen King read twilight and said it wasn’t the best. Ofc there might be some sexism on his part but he ain’t entirely wrong. Characters in twilight on the occasion make some weird choices or say some weird things, this is both A, because SM is delusional and swears its romantic. And B these characters are just crazy. It’s one of those story’s where you just sit back and don’t need to think to much about it because it doesn’t really need to make sense. 

I mean some argue Renesmes whole character was created just so Jacob can get a eventual love interest and is a reason to stop the werewolves and vampires attacking each other for when Bella finally dies and becomes a vampire (breaking the treaty) Now that’s a real plot device. 

Also, I do believe that SM is racist however if she never made Jacob native I don’t think anything would change. 

The topic of wether it was Edward vs Jacob or really Human vs Vampire doesn’t make to much sense to me. I remember Edward saying if Bella truly wanted to he’d be in a open relationship with her if it made her happy. So realistically, she could be a vampire but still be with Jacob. She could’ve chose Jacob but still turned if she really wanted.

Even if the imprinting was Jacobs choices or not it’s still weird. I thinking it’s natural to feel weird/view Jacob as weird even if isn’t not his choice. I mean Renesme is born to allow Bella to be a vampire without the cullens facing repercussions for turning her (breaking the treaty) and is being groomed into having a relationship with a man who is 17 years older then her because he never got his chance with Bella. 

If it were me, and my daughter is destined to be followed around by a man who witness her birth and will follow her around until she comes of age I would be uncomfortable too.

**That being said,** I agree now regarding  *What the hell, Edward?* He had at least a glimpse at the *depth* and obssessiveness of Bella's future reaction...and thought, ""Yes, leaving will save her life and be the best thing?'

**At the same time,** I have always thought, *What the hell, Bella* - a boy leaves you and you crumble in profound grief and loss - as if you have no strength, resiliency, autonomy, will, interests, or ability to heal, outside of him or having him in your life? *""Love, life, meaning...over.""*

Edward thought about killing Victoria just as revenge for her part in trying to kill Bella, but he had no idea she herself would be seeking revenge. Vampires don't generally go out of their way to avenge a friend.

1ityq0c,Edward and Bella’s Toxic Relationship - New Moon,mdu82en,2025-02-20 17:51:46,"You are going to get a shit ton of Edward apologists coming up with excuses and explanations answering here.  The truth is that what happened after Edward left was not only predictable but probable. People will say he did it because he cares or because he didn't know. But he did know because he was actually out hunting for Victoria. I don't know how he could think the best place to find her wasn't in Forks. It's absolutely the most likely place. 

Given the facts of the situation one has to choose what it actually says about Edward. My theory is that Edward is not in touch with his real feelings and motives. He believes with all his heart that he is doing everything because he loves Bella. But his focus is and continues to be his own feelings. He believes he knows what is best for Bella despite what Bella says and despite what Alice says. She warned him, if you read Midnight Sun, that Bella would not fare well if he left. She actually showed him pictures of how she would look after he left.  

Given the accuracy of Alice's visions, you'd think he would have chosen a different way. But Edward is a drama queen. I believe he is attached to the drama and romantic idea of star crossed lovers. Remember he was 17 when he was changed. At every turn his motivation remains what Edward thinks is best for Bella. He NEVER entertains the possibility that he could be wrong. Which is incredible given that all evidence says otherwise. Even in Volterra in the face of Aro having Bella killed he will not agree to change Bella. In my thinking this is unforgivable. Alice has to step up and show Aro that Bella will become a vampire. 

Edward hates himself yet is continually Arrogant in his actions towards Bella. He under estimates her continually. He never believed that Bella's love could be equal to his. Even after they reunite he treats her as someone he has to protect from herself. He lies to her, he disables her truck, he has Alice hold her prisoner. Right up until Bella becomes a vampire and to a degree even after that he underestimates her. He refuses to teach her to fight. She has to prove herself continually. All this tells me that Edward is so arrogantly self centered he is incapable of seeing Bella as an entity apart from himself. I love the fanfiction that has Bella leaving Edward. I certainly would have.",Dazzling-Treacle1092
1ityq0c,Edward and Bella’s Toxic Relationship - New Moon,mdudv2j,2025-02-20 18:17:44,"Well good news is their resolution is happily ever after with a baby. Common knowledge so I don’t think I’m spoiling anything.

I mean I think...you’re judging him a bit too harshly. You know Victoria is coming and you already know the premise of Books 3 and 4. 

SURE being dumped is awful but I don’t know if him leaving was the toxic trait. I would challenge that claim if that is your claim. Personally, I think everyone is free to leave a relationship if they’re not feeling it, even if it would shatter the other person’s heart. 

Which...did shatter Bella but...it was a growing experience and pushed her to live beyond her Edward bubble by forcibly popping it for her. So yay unknown byproduct? (half sarcasm) I would say that is his most toxic trait. Unilateral decision-making without conversation or room to be challenged and have the possibility of not getting his way. People claim she had no autonomy but I disagree but won’t go into length. He’s been crippled his ability IMO. NO CRITICAL THINKING ABILITY or emotional intelligence in this guy. Zero.
But circling back, the toxic-ness was that he didn’t discuss why he left Bella with and that’s the paternalistic part of his toxic trait. 

Edward isn’t Alice and he had no way of knowing about Victoria. They left because Jasper went nuts because she got a paper cut. That scared the shit out of Edward. She got thrown through glass. He had to hold a feral Jasper down with Emmett to protect Bella. Maybe it was more trouble than it was worth to be with a human if this is what it did to his family... Jasper is always wears a look of pain because he wants blood. The house was legitimately unsafe for Bella. Edward’s family was UNSAFE for Bella. And honestly, BELLA WAS UNSAFE FOR HIS FAMILY. 

Victoria was an intelligent woman and was able to hide her true intentions from Alice. James talked about it to Victoria. At that point Laurent had peaced out of James’ little travel party. And because the werewolves take over being the supernatural shit in her life, Alice couldn’t see her future clearly. She was pissed when she realized Jacob is a wolf. She claims that’s why she couldn’t see Bella and her future. She couldn’t see who pulled her out of the water which is what trigger little Eddie Boi to go on his little expedition. And Victoria hides her intention by sending Laurent, who looks like a friend because he gave them a tip on James. Personally, I’m suspicious of his actions in the first book and wonder if it wasn’t just a ploy? 
And I don’t think we should overlook the fact we’re talking about TEENAGERS. Frozen at 17. 

Development stopped at 17. A lot of teenagers tend to be pretty arrogant and that’s absolutely a toxic trait we should be growing of. He’s not used to NOT KNOWING people’s thoughts as exemplified by his bulldozing or attempting to bulldoze Bella all the time. So I think there’s a lot to blame Edward for but Victoria....not really one of them. Like NO ONE saw it coming. No one saw James coming and it was an external shock to their environment. The war was brought to them. THEY didn’t choose it. Alice is what 16? Maybe 19? Still not fully developed and had a woman who knew how to manipulate her ability to see visions. Can’t really blame her...for not seeing or knowing. Even if we remove the whole werewolf making the future blurry aspect. 

As far as “fend for herself”, removing Victoria, SHE IS AN AUTONOMOUS 17 year old at this point. Took care of both parents. Had a job. If we should be angry at anyone leaving a teen to fend for themselves, totally should not be the other teenager in this situation. And Eddie Boi, in his “omniscient” way, dumped her because of his toxic trait which is making unilateral decisions for someone who is completely capable with brain compacity that arguably matches his in developmental stages. But “leaving her to fend for herself” is not something toxic IMO. Because teenagers can’t leave other teenagers to fend for themselves in paternalistic ways. That is also inaccurate IMO when you consider all Edward was Bobskies. Bro just likes to claim he knows shit like every arrogant teen. One thing he probably did know safely and isn’t incorrect, if werewolves did exist, they weren’t a threat to Bella and their jobs were to protect their territory from vampires which extended to Forks. 

And like you said HE DIDN’T KNOW about Jacob. He couldn’t predict the future. Alice somehow couldn’t see Victoria. No one was watching Laurent it would. And he was written off like Victoria. Everyone makes piss poor decisions when they’re lacking vital information. Fucking sucks but I’m not falling on my sword for not knowing what I didn’t know and not having someone who did know around.",BloodyWritingBunny
1ityq0c,Edward and Bella’s Toxic Relationship - New Moon,mdwjj1q,2025-02-21 00:34:01,"If I remember correctly, Edward had Alice keep an eye on Victoria’s decisions. So if Victoria decided to go after Edward or Bella, they figured they would know about it. However, neither of them accounted for the fact that the wolves blocked Alice’s visions, and that Victoria would also be able to find a way around them. 

Also, at the point where Edward breaks up with Bella, Victoria wasn’t wanting revenge yet. If you read the Illustrated Guide, it says that Victoria had no plans on getting revenge for James until around the time that she sent Laurent to check if the Cullens were in Forks still. She had been building the newborn army at that point, but she originally started building it to have protection for herself. She changed her goals for the newborns after Laurent died. So Edward wouldn’t have really known that Victoria would seek revenge because Victoria didn’t even want revenge at that point. Edward was only tracking her so he could get revenge for what happened to Bella in Phoenix, not because he actually thought Victoria would go after her.",muaddict071537

Edward is very aware of how danger prone Bella is, they talk about it a lot. If she died somehow while the Cullens were gone, which was always a possibility regardless of Victoria, was the plan for everyone to just keep it a secret from Edward forever so he wouldn't kill himself? 

He basically set himself up for a situation where somebody, at some point, was going to have to call him up and let him know that Bella had died somehow. And he was always going to saddle that unlucky family member with the guilt of ""making him kill himself."" I kinda get why Rosalie was just like ""This is ridiculous, somebody has to tell him.

1ityq0c,Edward and Bella’s Toxic Relationship - New Moon,mduppu8,2025-02-20 19:11:26,"I think that’s correct: because Edward assumes Victoria would behave like himself.

Because if someone killed Bella, he would kill them. He wouldn’t do the psycho thing and go after their mate and kill their mate and then proceeded to kill them afterward. Which is definitely what James was doing so it’s interesting that Eddie Boi didn’t think of she might just be as sadistic as James.

But you know he’s pretty arrogant and thinks he knows everything so can’t say I’m surprised he doesn’t have the ability/wherewithal to consider possibilities of people who don’t think like him. I think at this point it has been proven that Edward does not have a lot of critical thinking ability or emotional intelligence skills. Arguably due to his ability crippling him so….

But I think we should cut him some slack about that vision Alice showed him, though I didn't read Midnight Sun. Like I think in the initial 4 books it was implied he knew she would be heartbroken and Alice told him she'd be crushed. But not like almost killed by Victoria. Like Alice's vision showed a teenage emotional meltdown after being dumped. So...I kind of cut him some slack there honestly. 

Though that is 100% his toxic trait showing through: making unilateral decisions for everyone in his arrogant omniscient self, as a 17 year old kid.

And the same way Bella underestimated his love for her he doesn’t think she’s capable of feeling deeply for him and believes it’s just the trick of his vampirehood aka his beauty and scent drawing her in but not HIM. He treats her like a child but I will give him grace in saying that IS how men treated women in the early 1900s that was what he was accustomed to before he changed.

Maybe it would have taken longer than your average teenage heartbreak, but Alice can’t see 20 years into the future in any real way. She couldn’t see Jacob coming, and he helped Bella make huge improvements to her quality of life. Edward knows how quickly Alice’s visions can change. 

I don’t think Bella would have loved anyone like Edward, but she probably would have been happy enough and human. Which is extremely important to Edward who said he would stand in fire for the chance to be human.",No-Manufacturer9125

To your first point  If we are talking about real life yes there's a good chance for Bella to be happy. But this is not only a supernatural connection to Edward but to the Cullens and the possiblility for immortality. Can you imagine having come so close to such an amazing existence to have it be snatched from you? You would always know it was out there and that you came within a breath of your dream life. When Edward left he took that possibly away. 

Yes Bella could have ended up with Jacob but they weren't imprinted. And she would always be a mortal looking in from the outside. Watching it but never being a part of it. I do not see Bella getting over that. She would have tried her best to be happy but it would have been more surface than anything. Underneath there would have been a lifelong sadness...especially as she aged.",Dazzling-Treacle1092

It’s both ending her human, and in his eyes, killing her soul. That’s a big ask of your partner, and he doesn’t want her to someday regret it, which is fair assumption.

Would I want the Cullen’s immortality? Absolutely not haha. It did not see glamorous to me, and they all (except for Emmett) would have done anything to go back. 

Imprinting was supposed to be extremely rare and the wolves are mortal. They will eventually age and die. She would have fit in with them especially the wolf WAGs who were all just run of the mill humans lol.",No-Manufacturer9125
1ityq0c,Edward and Bella’s Toxic Relationship - New Moon,meq8lll,2025-02-25 16:55:56,I met my now husband when I was 20 and definitely had a ton of people question how deep our instant connection was or that it was just another crush and we would break up soon after. We said I love you within a week of being together and I found it hard to breathe when we became long distance. So I completely empathize with Bella and try to think of what it had felt like had we ended because he thought he was “no good for me”. I live by the philosophy now to believe men when they tell you who they are but back at 20 I would’ve fought him to stay with him the same way Bella did.

1ityq0c,Edward and Bella’s Toxic Relationship - New Moon,me0c9rp,2025-02-21 16:14:14,"The immortality thing is definitely individual. I don't know if I would want it either but Bella did. And she was definitely bonded to the Cullens as well. I don't buy into the whole Edward believing he was taking Bella's soul bit. Bella kind of blew that theory away when she saved Edward in Volterra. That was tied to the taking of human lives to survive and it was obviously proven unnecessary. 

Anyway as I said Edward didn't really believe it either because he thought he had died and gone to heaven. I believe his motivation was more singular in believing that Bella would have to fight the urge to kill and perhaps carry guilt as he did for giving in to the temptation for human blood. 

And this once again was him underestimating Bella. I understand why he would in this instance. No one could know how vampirism would affect her. But it's also tied to his view of himself. He cannot concieve of Bella surpassing him in anything. She is just a silly mortal who knows nothing. He calls her silly and absurd on more than one occasion. 

I'm sorry but I can't be convinced that Bella would have been happy with any life but an immortal life with Edward once she knew it was possible.",Dazzling-Treacle1092

Yes Edward's biggest problem was that he didn't have faith in himself and his own goodness therefore he couldn't have the faith that Bella could do it and retain her goodness. Had he understood what he finally came to understand he would not have not left her. He just couldn't get past himself and his own hang-ups to really see who Bella was and what she needed.",Dazzling-Treacle1092
1ityq0c,Edward and Bella’s Toxic Relationship - New Moon,mdwetvm,2025-02-21 00:05:05,That’s personally my favorite of the series. So much insight.,handwritinganalyst
1ityq0c,Edward and Bella’s Toxic Relationship - New Moon,me1iddv,2025-02-21 19:29:22,"I think the life Bella wanted is the one she ended up with, and she is happiest in that life, but yeah, she would have adapted to another. She already was adapting. Also in New Moon the only Cullens she was truly bonded to were Edward and Alice. I think she liked the others a lot, but they’d only been together like six months. 

He’s probably still 90/10 on the damning of the souls of vampires. Which I feel like can be true for almost atheist type person. There is always a part of you that thinks “what if?” I still think he doesn’t fully know and it’s a huge gamble in his eyes. 

I think Edward can be kind of arrogant at times, but I don’t think he’s underestimating Bella or thinking he’s smarter than her about her own desires. He just knows what any person alive long enough, human beings change. Which he is right about. We actually watch Bella change her mind on two huge things that she claimed she would never change her mind. In New Moon and Eclipse she says she absolutely wants to be changed right after graduation because she needs to stay a teenager forever like him, but in Breaking Dawn after they start having sex she decides it’s not the big of a deal if she stays human for a while and enjoys college. She also claims she could never imagine wanting kids, even though both Edward and Rosalie warn her that’s a huge thing to give up, and it’s something she really needs to think about. She’s adamant it won’t matter to her, but when she gets pregnant she’s willing to die in order to have her baby. It’s fair to say Bella is stubborn and very singular minded. She says this about herself. Edward knows this about her. It’s not thinking she’s a dumb mortal. It’s just he knows his girlfriend and he understands human nature.",No-Manufacturer9125

1isoe1l,Edward’s big “reveal” in New Moon,mdk35u0,2025-02-19 03:57:58,"And even if someone thought the guy was ACTUALLY sparkling instead of just covered in glitter, they wouldn’t think he was a vampire. 

I think the Volturi would punish Edward for it, not because it actually would’ve exposed the secret, but because Edward did it with the intent to expose the secret. And they probably would’ve known that if they didn’t kill Edward for it, he’d just go to more and more drastic measures (that’s in the scenario that Bella was actually dead).",muaddict071537
1isoe1l,Edward’s big “reveal” in New Moon,mdkkgbr,2025-02-19 06:02:48,"So, sure, that’s probably the least revealing thing he could do to still get them to kill him - but that may be the point. If he shows himself (I’ll get back to his appearance in a moment), the Volturi will take him out just in case and not knowing what else he might be planning. But it’s not necessarily something that will truly disrupt their rule over Volterra or vampire-kind, which Edward may have specifically chosen in an attempt to keep the Volturi from going after Carlisle and the family in retribution. If he’d *really* revealed them I could totally see the Volturi punishing the family on top of killing Edward, and Edward would know if that was any part of Aro’s plan. 

Now, his appearance, as has been pointed out, is closer to a prismatic crystal than body glitter.  I don’t remember what Bella’s thoughts are in the meadow in Twilight, but in Midnight Sun, Edward is confused that she seems afraid for him. But then he realizes that in the sun, “what [he] resembled most was a man on fire.”  That would certainly draw attention and possibly panic in an extremely crowded place with very narrow exits. Stampede, anyone? Not a good look. 

Also, as has been pointed out, the daytime of St. Marcus’s Day is a relatively solemn religious holiday, that the city takes quite seriously - and brings in visitors from all around to be so crowded. I never got a good handle on exactly what everyone is standing around the piazza for, all we see is Bella fighting her way across to him; she doesn’t really look around. But it’s not a party atmosphere. In the evening, when they’re leaving, it’s more of what we might call a party.",abczoomom
1isoe1l,Edward’s big “reveal” in New Moon,mdm2bn7,2025-02-19 13:46:27,"Yeah in major cities with regular festivals, yeah, that would be fine. Theres a dude here in Pittsburgh who i see at every major holiday celebration down town covered in (insert color associated with insert holiday here) glitter and a shimmering speedo and usually some hat. The fourth of july is wild. Glitter would not go amiss.

But in midnight sun, and in short second life of bree, to bellas (and bree and diegos) eyes, it looks like they're on fire with how the sun refracts the light on and IN their skin. So it would be more like glowing than glittering like depicted in the movie. Thats why it was so much more of a concern.

To be fair though, none of the main series books mention it looking like fire. You'd only know that if you read MS or TSSLoBT.

to add on!

1isoe1l,Edward’s big “reveal” in New Moon,mdqoxpu,2025-02-20 03:21:34,"I’m confused why they have this adaptation at all. Everything else about them serves to make them more efficient hunters of human beings. Edward says as much himself. I know a human couldn't do shit about it even if they did see a vampire coming, but Edward also points out how vampires are *so* specialized to hunt humans that a lot of it is kinda redundant. There isn't really a clear advantage that comes with being highly visible in the sunlight like there is with other vampire characteristics like their senses/speed/strength/beauty. Carlisle theorizes that vampires have existed as long as humans have, and Homo sapiens came out of Africa, so the sun would likely have always been a problem for vampires who wanted to be stealthy for any reason. 

Personally I think it would have been cooler and made more if their skin instead could camouflage to its surroundings in the sun or something. This would have actually had a practical application for hunting, and been a better basis for the myth that vampires can't go out in the sunlight.",bluegirlrosee

1isoe1l,Edward’s big “reveal” in New Moon,mdxkhqo,2025-02-21 04:11:15,"Yeah I agree with you that evolution is funky sometimes, tbh I just don't think it's likely that vampires evolved the same way as everything else on earth. If you think about it, they can't. There's not really any way to pass advantageous genetic traits down to the next generation of vampires. They have *some* control over future generations in the sense that they can choose which humans to change, but that means vampires would only ever be able to evolve as fast as humanity. The people who become the vampires are the only changing variable, there's nothing to suggest that what the venom actually *does* to you has changed much at all over the years. The way vampires seem to exist only to slaughter and eat humans, and have no other ecological niche or purpose outside of that, is also strange. They don't make waste or breathe air, and the way they convert calories from food into kinetic energy kinda doesn't make sense under our laws of physics.

That's why my personal theory is that vampire venom is actually a substance sent here by extra terrestrials and was designed to quickly wipe out the dominant species of a given planet. Infected humans, however, retained enough logic and consciousness to see the sense in moderating their feeding so as to not deplete their food source. Earth was then abandoned by whoever sent the venom, and the vampires remained.",bluegirlrosee

for one, it has perfect pacing whereas i found twilight to be pretty jarring in places with regard to the nomads. and as a screenwriter i find new moon to be a perfect adaptation of a book to film. i also prefer the overall warmer tone in new moon but that’s a personal thing, i like that soundtrack more with the killers, thom yorke, the first muse x twilight track, the camera work is also more interesting in new moon (ex. the breakup scene in the woods) 
the imagery in twilight is really good though especially in regards to the meadow but overall feels random bc why would edward have a long conversation with bella in the pouring rain?? overall twilight kinda feels like it’s trying to be a thriller rather than the love story it actually is
i think as films the ranking that makes the most sense is new moon, twilight, breaking dawn pt1, breaking dawn pt2, and then all the way in hell is eclipse",twilightsaga_newmoon

New Moon is INDEED the worst of the bunch. Indeed.

I honestly think that's why it was so popular. I think it came into popularity at a time when suicidal ideation was trending and a lot of people were/are still having issues with just finding daily life worth living. We all want profound connection and yet everyone seems so distant on this 9-5 work life world. 

So here's this blank slate unhappy girl looking for love and of course we all relate to that. But when he turns to guilt and shame and disappeared on her she went zombie mode which is like girl....gotta find something to drive you outside of someone else. And she slowly tries to do that. Tries to find friends, tries and largely fails fmto find happiness. Even when Edward showed back up she's like he just feels guilty, he's gonna leave me at the drop of a hat, I'm unworthy blah blah. No self love, no security that she's a whole person who can survive alone. Nope. Not untill renesme does she say hey I'm gonna go my own way. Go ahead get mad at me I know I'm right to save my baby. Everyone was mad but she held her ground. She felt justified and like a good person and felt like good about sharing her own opinion. 

Then she's almost reborn and goes thru this litteral death phase almost a resurrection and has to ask everyone from all over to just witness her righteousness before the voltori. Sonits like she faces her own inner critic that says shes not worthy and then faces rhe outter critic the viltori that say shes not worthy and she has to reavh out to others across the world and say she is worthy enough to ask for them to wotness her and help her. She deserves help, shes gonna ask for it now. And she is righteous the archetype of a martyred and risen again mother figure. And she's like no one can touch me now. She has the power of self control, emotional regulation, compassion that stops any fierce hunger and wow...then she finally has the power to let someone in. To let Edward into her head. Once she individuates as a whole self driven self loving person she's amazing. That'd what we all want.

1kfw7e3,Rereading Twilight as someone more seasoned (older) -- thoughts on New Moon.,mr0njko,2025-05-07 05:17:53,"THIS IS SO REFRESHING TO READ and quite honestly I agree with you on all points. I was such a big fan when I was teenager, read all the books, watched all the movies, sketched “Team Edward” on my notebooks in school, and desperately hoped I would also find a hot vampire boyfriend and a hot werewolf best friend who were fighting to claim ME! (lol, teenagers). 

I rewatched all the movies last week as a grown woman and quite honestly saw so many red flags and loopholes in Meyer’s storytelling. I agree that Bella is a teenager who grew up on her own taking care of the mother so I can see the appeal in having a traditional caregiving bf like Edward. But I didn’t see specific reasons or scenarios where their attraction turned into “true love”. It was curiosity at first on Bella’s end, and it was clear that her side of love was more superficial and teenage-y while Edward thought their love was all consuming and written by God himself. 

We don’t really see Bella interacting with anyone else and was confused how Alice became her best friend - and yes, Alice was annoying. She gave ‘the spoilt only child who needed all the attention’ and Bella just existed in a corner without really being able to set boundaries. But same with Jacob, we know they grew up together but there’s rarely any mention of them keeping in touch and suddenly they’re best friends in new moon?? When? And how? 

Quite honestly this story should have ended the moment Bella realised what Edward was. That’s it. I don’t understand the “we are soulmates” arc bc there’s honestly no evidence presented from Bella’s side other than pure obsession and lust. 

And tbh I agree that Alice could have been a better friend and RESPOND TO AN EMAIL like who does that knowing your “best friend” is going through a hard time.

I totally respect your opinions. And though I do think Bella is very immature, I love her so much. I read the series as a middle schooler/early high schooler so her dramatic emotional takes made sense to me, especially as I really felt like a Bella in high school when my Edward left me and I loved my Jacob, but not in the way he loved me. Rereading reminds me of the intensity of teenage feelings and reactions because I remember feeling the same way. 

“There is no wisdom in growing old if one doesn’t remember what it’s like to be young”. 

Twilight feels like teenage love. It feels cringy and desperate and immature because IT IS. That’s the part that feels real to me. ",Alternative-Bad-6403
1kfw7e3,Rereading Twilight as someone more seasoned (older) -- thoughts on New Moon.,mr2dkzv,2025-05-07 13:52:42,"I believe wholeheartedly that Meyer *wanted* a story where Bella was selfless, but being pretty new to writing at the time just didn’t know how to work it in sufficiently. There’s a scene fairly early into MS that makes it clear (to me, anyway) that Meyer recognized this and was trying to retroactively add in some of that missing characterization – during the month that Edward doesn’t speak to her after the van incident, he watches her at school and notices a lot of kind things she does for other students.

The same can apply to the Bella&Alice point. I believe Meyer *wanted* the pair to be best friends, but just didn’t know how to fit it in around her primary love story. However, IMO, I don’t think it’s *entirely* unreasonable for Alice to stay away during NM. Not specifically because Edward tells her to, but because it would stand to reason that, as the resident clairvoyant and the partner of the vampire who lost control, Alice might be feeling some guilt about not being about to stop this event that hurt (in various ways) her friend, her brother, and her partner; avoidance is a very common, though unhealthy, response to guilt. We never really see that in the text IIRC, but again: Bella’s perspective, inexperienced writer, I think there’s a reasonable amount of space for readers’ differing interpretations.

Honestly all of your points are completely valid. Basically the only thing keeping me from throwing my own hands up and complaining is that I try very hard to keep in mind that most of the dumbass decisions in these books are canonically made by teenagers. Immortal teenagers, sometimes, but teenagers nonetheless. 15-19 year olds are frequently a little bit stupid (said with love) so them being stupid in the books is just realism to me haha.",meumixer
1kfw7e3,Rereading Twilight as someone more seasoned (older) -- thoughts on New Moon.,mr2zyht,2025-05-07 15:43:27,"I will say it's been a minute (read: years) since I last read the books or saw the movies, but I do remember a few things. Unfortunately, we don't get to see much of the relationship development between Bella and the other Cullens because of the time skip between Twilight and New Moon.

We do find out that Alice helped out *a lot* with Bella's physical care needs after she left the hospital, which really endeared her to Charlie big time. I imagine Alice talked his ear off during that time, too. Otherwise, all we really learn is that Bella had a ""perfect summer"" during those months between the two books. This always bothered me. I mean, I would've been fine with not having chapters covering those months, but that summer is just literally never talked about again.

As far as Bella is concerned, I know that as a teen, I really related to her because I was introverted and lonely and felt like I didn't fit in with everyone else and had abysmal self-esteem. Everything she does makes a lot of sense from that lens, or at least it did to me. That doesn't mean it's healthy. It certainly got me into some terrible and truly abusive relationships over the years. But it is a real way to be and feel about oneself, especially when that young. I'm almost 40 and still feel much the same way, though different. I've been changed by the years and experiences, but at my core, I'm still that same person. Still introverted and lonely. Low self-worth and self-esteem. Feeling out of place in the world. I might be willing to speak out more, and I struggle more with feeling any kind of enjoyment from things I used to love, and I feel more disconnected from myself. Surviving a malignant narcissist will do that to you. I still see myself in Bella. Maybe even more now. Maybe I don't have the objectivity to see her more like you do.

Alice doesn't know any other way to be than how she is. She doesn't remember being human, but it doesn't sound like she had anything resembling a normal human experience. She has nothing to draw on about how relationships and linear time really works. She's always living according to her visions. She sees what will be and accepts it as reality. She doesn't understand all the in-between bits that need to happen linearly to get to the future she saw. It will be then so why can't it be now? She sees that she and Bella will be friends, so what is the point in acting like it isn't already true? She has some boundary issues as a result of forgetting no one else experiences life like she does, which is concerning, but I think understanding that about her makes it at least somewhat forgivable.",moonlit-soul

This reaction is why I heavily believe that SMeyer didn’t even understand the characters she was writing. Any self respecting cop-raised individual would be beyond livid. I genuinely believe she was dealing with withdrawal, as she expressed all the symptoms of a long term addict coming off of their drug of choice, and she was ecstatic to have her fix providers back, even if it was unconscious. As a fellow child of a cop, it drive me spare. It’s not a romance and Bella is a very unreliable narrator. It is very much a story of youthful abuse and encouraged acceptance of that abuse because “he does it because he loves me”. There’s a reason abusive Jacob and abusive Edward are such a common trope. It’s provided in the source material. I just hate what SMeyer did to Jacob.",artic_fox-wolf1984

1. I think that Bella’s love is written very much from a young person who is has very low confidence and is insecure. I read these for the first time at 19, and they couldn’t feel more true. That’s where this deep love and bond comes from. It’s puppy love.
2. I have found myself annoyed with Alice but for other reasons. She can be very selfish with the whole I’m doing your wedding the way I want to vs how you want to (as an example). But even that feels like ok we have a flawed character but they’re having fun together.
3. Thank you for the Jane Eyre lesson. It’s been sitting on my shelf for a long time, and here I am rereading twilight lol. But there is an equal power shift in Bella’s mindset at end of NM. She is always holding Edward up on a pedestal and content to live from his elbow haha. BUT now she truly sees that he loves her too. Not just a moments curiosity. She understands his dramatic suicide mission is that he’s also flawed and desperate for her, just like she is for him. They’re equals in their relationship.

(Maybe just every fiction book, but I notice it most with romance.) Twilight is perhaps worse than average on that front, but still, I don't expect much. 


It helps a lot that the characters are teenagers. Teenagers really do form attachments really quickly based on almost nothing. So it's shallow and maybe unsatisfying, but not unbelievable; I do believe the characters would feel and do the things they feel and do.


And I never minded how Bella immediately forgave Edward and Alice, never gave them shit, and continued to see herself as inferior. Anything else would have felt totally out of character, and consistent characterisation is more important to me than character's making good choices or acting how I would act. ",20061901
1kfw7e3,Rereading Twilight as someone more seasoned (older) -- thoughts on New Moon.,mr0kj5b,2025-05-07 04:52:41,"Bella's shield is more than just protecting her from psychic abilities like Edward has. It never allowed her any real connection because noone could ever even see her behind it. We might not be able to imagine it, but for her it's like she was always alone. No such thing as human connection for her. So of course when someone so perfect and good smelling gives her attention and tries to know her, she will cling to him no matter what. 




But Edward failed with ever having anything real with Bella because he only saw her as a martyr and savior from his darkness. The only person who ever got close to Bella was Jacob but then everything went down with him in Eclipse. 




Alice likes Bella because she likes the visions she gets with Bella. Alice is just chasing her visions, she doesn't care about anything she can't see.",
1kfw7e3,Rereading Twilight as someone more seasoned (older) -- thoughts on New Moon.,mrac1sc,2025-05-08 18:16:18,"Bella is an overfunctioning, self-abandoning, please-don’t-leave-me-I’ll-die kind of girl. She has porous boundaries. She's often in an adaptive freeze mode that just looks like passivity. She doesn’t think she matters unless someone else reflects her back to herself. *”* It’s all right there in the New Moon catatonia montage. Edward leaves, and she doesn’t just get sad—she collapses into a *void*. The only thing that brings her back? Thrill-seeking hallucinations of his disapproval. That’s not melodrama; that’s dysregulated attachment chasing co-regulation via imagined connection. Her low self-worth bleeds through everything she does. She’s constantly minimizing herself, downplaying her own danger, acting like Edward is some kind of god and she’s just... “ordinary.” The internalized self-concept is so unworthy that she literally chooses undeath—she wants to erase herself to be ""good enough"" to stay with the only person who's made her feel seen. I think she's never had the space to individuate because she's always had to seek out external validation and caretake for the people around her.

I think this is why Bella doesn't tend to demand apologies from the ~~people~~ vampires who owe them to her. She's so down on herself, especially when the Cullens leave, that she is simply relieved at the re-appearance of Alice and figures this isn't a moment for boundaries, this is a moment of rescue. She doesn't hold a grudge when Alice shows up again, because in her inner world, she’s grateful anyone came back at all. She doesn’t expect reparations — she’s just relieved she’s not alone in the void anymore. It's not forgiveness born of compassion, it's fawning, self-protective appeasement.

I agree that Bella does have a characterization, and that's why I don't love the ""blank slate"" thing that got attached to her. We all can talk meaningfully about how our temperaments compare to Bella's because she does have her own characterization. Bella is a Virgo. She is also pensive, moody, hypersensitive, stubborn, emotionally reactive but quietly so — which is why she resonates so deeply with readers who felt like that as teens. The problem is that Meyer sometimes tells us she’s selfless and noble when, in truth, she’s kind of reckless, impulsive, and emotionally myopic. But that's not a flaw in Bella, that's just being a 17-year-old with abandonment trauma and a martyr complex. Sure, she's not always good in a moral or narrative sense, but she's relateable, even if not always aspirational. She absolutely can be manipulative, dishonest, obsessive, selfish, and impulsive. The ennui of her inner narration can at times be grating. But all of those things make her up. I think Meyer's impulse to paint her as always right/good/nice can frankly flatten her. I think it's fine that Bella is a messy character.

I do think that the Edward/Bella dynamic can at times be forced. Sometimes, Meyer simply tells us that they are passionately in love instead of writing the kind of dynamic and bond that makes us feel it. I think the two of them struggle to effectively communicate. For instance, in New Moon, Edward's grievances are that he fears that Bella becoming a vampire would damn her immortal soul, but that Bella saying human puts her in continual danger, and he struggles with being morally complicit in this, that he is letting his own desire for love and romance to become selfish by keeping her in this position. But he doesn't tell her this. Instead, he goes, ""You suck, and I don't like you"" and then faults Bella for believing this. It's just piss poor communication.

I think Bella gets as much hate as she does because she represents a shadow side in people that they don't like. Bella absolutely triggers projection in readers. She embodies a kind of vulnerable, insecure femininity that many people — especially women — are taught to loathe in themselves. She’s passive, obsessed with romantic connection, self-effacing, emotionally intense. That combo makes her a perfect vessel for cultural backlash. But when we sit with her, we find someone who’s doing her best to survive a world that doesn't reflect her worth back to her. She's not weak. She's just wounded. Bella is the patron saint of psychic girlhood vulnerability. And maybe that’s why she deserves compassion more than critique.

I'm not really Team Edward or Team Jacob, but I am Team Bella. *Twilight* is almost a mood piece on the overwhelming, all-consuming nature of first love — how it feels like a matter of life and death when you're a teen with a thousand emotions and no armor. Bella isn’t cool in the way pop culture tells us to be cool. She’s awkward, overwhelmed, self-sacrificial, intense. She's just a girl in a flannel, clutching at a feeling like it’s the only thing that makes her real. I loved her emotional complexity and that raw, unfiltered ache that she carries with her.

And look, the backlash against Bella always had that faint whiff of internalized misogyny — like we’re only allowed to root for heroines who are quippy, empowered, and ""not like other girls."" But Bella is like a lot of girls. Sensitive, anxious, soft, defined by love in ways that feel shameful to admit. She doesn’t get power from swords — she gets power from the conviction that love is worth everything. That’s not weakness. That’s just... intense femininity in its most haunted, romantic form.",DonutPeaches6

Edward is a dumb teenager who thinks he is being selfless, but abandoning her while Victoria is still out there and Laurent knows about her is…heartless. Carlisle and Esme at least should have seen that and sent someone to check on her from time to time, even without her knowing, if needed. Really Carlisle and Esme should have just stayed behind in Forks for a year until Bella was in college. 

I have to agree with Laurent when he says they must not have cared about her that much! Then Eddie comes back whining about how Bella believed all the things he said and how sad he was when he was gone. He treated her terribly (and I agree Alice did too). ",janeaustenfiend

1kfw7e3,Rereading Twilight as someone more seasoned (older) -- thoughts on New Moon.,mr1dp9m,2025-05-07 09:40:50,Bella is written with really low self worth. She apologizes for bleeding from her head to Jacob in the movie,SpiritMonster
1kfw7e3,Rereading Twilight as someone more seasoned (older) -- thoughts on New Moon.,ms7pfs7,2025-05-14 03:52:18,"Agreed. Nothing wrong with writing a character with devastatingly low self esteem...
But I think there's nothing outside of her persistent belief that she's not worthy of Edward's love that *really* sells the low self esteem angle. It makes it feel less like an inner demon she has to overcome when it only seems to exist in relation to comparing herself to a guy written to be literally perfect. (He sparkles in the sun. It's not a fair comparison.)
I'd say that I wish we could see this low self esteem affecting her in other ways, outside of romantic relationships, but unfortunately the entire scope of her existence is just her romantic relationships or potentially romantic relationships and how they affect her. 

It doesn't work IMHO to be like ""Well now that she's also a vampire she doesn't have to have a low self esteem anymore"". .a more satisfying storyline for her would have been
1.) A lot of missed opportunities or other ways a low self esteem has hurt her. 
2.).she overcomes the low self esteem 
3.) Fate rewards her conquering this inner demon by giving her that which she desires above all things- to finally be a vampire. 


Character rewarded for conquering her inner demons is a lot more satisfying than character conquering her inner demons by being rewarded. 
""Yeah, I used to be a big coward but then someone literally kept giving me money until I decided to stop."" 
Just doesn't work.",eriennexton

And it kills her not to and she is over it and doesn’t want to do what Edward asks anymore.

1ilnq5s,Finished the entire Twilight Saga,mc4ptq6,2025-02-11 04:26:34,"Yeah it's almost as if Stephenie wasn't intending for edward to leave when she wrote Twilight, but then when she wrote Midnight Sun she had to have Edward say and do all of the things he did in twilight but now with the full knowledge that he was going to leave. Like Edward was absolutely a dick for that, but I don't think Stephenie wanted him to be a dick. I think she was trying to balance different aspects of his personality and the things that had to happen, and that was the best she could come up with. 

Tbh, this is exactly why I will never understand people who publish things that are still being written. Granted Twilight was written as a standalone so it's not like she set out to do that, but still, that is the standard way publishing works and I just can't imagine it. How can you permanently lock in what happens in book 1 when you aren't sure yet what happen in book 2, or 3, or n? What if things change, and what you wrote in an earlier book doesn't make sense anymore? You literally can't do anything about it.

1hwt8qt,Colorpop’s initail Twilight launch missed the mark by reducing the saga to a green filter....,m64v484,2025-01-08 23:19:01,"I thought the filter was more blue than green! I think the greens are supposed to be reminiscent of Forks, Bella talks so much about how green everything is. But the palettes is quite blue, personally I think the blue filter is so iconic and I know cool toned palettes are harder to come by so I kind of love the launch, I don’t purchase eyeshadows so it’s not for me but I love looking. I do think cool toned palettes tend to get a less enthusiastic reception because not everyone loves them. 

Honestly though your descriptions of the palettes you want are actually fairly close to what I feel we did get! They did do a silver shimmer highlight called vampire skin in the OG launch! 

The cullen themed description you gave is pretty much on par with the Twilight Palette, cool blues, silvers and greys, a sprinkling of neutrals for versatility. 

The wolves and Volturi pretty much are the new moon palette, warm browns and golds, blacks, reds. 

I am very curious where they will go with Eclipse as you said. I think Breaking Dawn could be quite colorful representing Bella’s new life. She mentions so much how rich the colours are I really think they could get creative with it.",handwritinganalyst

I think it’s also a bit of a nostalgia factor for me; the first movie is the whole reason I read any of the books and watched the rest of the movies. The cool filter is also so distinct to that first movie that I feel like Colourpop not honoring that in some way would make zero sense. I think you have great ideas, though, for what Colourpop could’ve done differently with Cullen/wolf pack/volturi palettes. I would almost prefer that to releasing a new line for every film, but that’s maybe not as smart from a business/money making perspective.",xthe_performerx

1dqsynz,The Twilight Saga: Core Concepts,laqx94z,2024-06-28 22:17:29,"Fantastic analysis, absolutely nailed it. 

It's left deliberately ambiguous, but I also believe fate is a real and present force in the Twilight universe and you've given a great rundown of its apparent manifestations. Of course there are reasonable in-universe explanations for pretty much everything, and the rest could be chalked up to coincidence, but taken together all of it suggests some power subtly pulling strings. 

You could also add how the other Cullen couples also seem fated to one degree or another, finding their perfect partners through unlikely circumstances. The strongest case IMO is for Alice and Jasper - that she saw him so clearly before she saw anything else points to them being destined to meet and fall in love, like no matter what she did the universe would find a way to bring them together.",20061901

1acok78,Why does the Twilight Saga get me so emotional.,kjz8jqh,2024-01-28 17:51:51,"I totally get what you mean with the emotional unhealthiness of your relationship to it. 

Twilight is dangerous because, on the surface, it's an easily accessible, escapist, slice-of-life comfort story but beneath that it's a fundamentally gut-wrenching tragedy. 

So you cling to it because it's comfy and intensely relatable, but you also start hurting due to its inherent melancholy. 

It's kind of the best and the worst thing that could happen to an already shaky mental state, at the same time. 

It's funny that you bring this up just now, because I've recently noticed that, after a long time of feeling similar to the way you do, I've grown quite a bit more distant from the saga these days, and that it's probably better for my mental state, but I simultaneously feel like it's missing from my life. 

It really is like written crack lol. No idea how Meyer did it. 

I guess one just has to try and find a healthy balance of escapist immersion and a secure sense of self. 

Finally, if the movies already make you feel this way, I'd genuinely be careful with the books. 

They will, without exaggeration, amplify your current feelings _thousandfold_. It really is dangerously easy to get lost in those. I'd make sure to have at least some level of emotional stability on-lock before diving into them.

I think that it might be good to get it out of the way to feel out how the people around you feel about Twilight and those who like it so you can avoid them or (politely) ask them what they hate so much about it. If you feel that familiar pressure that makes you want to say they are wroing but you don't know how to express that they are wrong, ask if they have ever read it. Most likely they haven't and want to hate *Twilight* either because it's popular wherever they are to do so or because they haven't actually thought about asking for the appeal after reading some parts. Or they have seen the movies and decided those were *Twilight*. 

If they bring up how toxic the relationships are, (and I don't know what your thoughts are on that--if you have any make sure you have thought through them as much as you could and seek out how others think) point out how toxic several other movies that do not get as much flack as *Twilight* does. If Bella is ""stupid"", (which in a lot of ways, sure but all that hate is unnecessary), point out how Harry Potter, that guy in the *Taken* movies, many of the people in the Marvel movies, etc. all display people we would think are toxic in relationships and so on, yet they haven't received as much hate.

If they bring up how the love story doesn't make sense, ask about Jean Grey & Cyclops, Ron & Hermione, or **any** famous fictional couple you know who you feel society knows doesn't make sense or is abusive or downplays abuse and question why they don't think of those franchise/stories that still go uncriticized/hated.

""Nothing happens in Twilight""? Usually, people, when saying this, want a specific thing in their media and resent that a romance or *this* romance story has gained such popularity and decide that they will show how good they are act detecting bad media. Gives them an ego boost. Again, you could point out how many popular stories have no actual realism or substance yet remain popular for emotional value.

In other words, try actually talking to people about the series and if they merely try to dismiss you, imply their ignorance of the actual story versus the franchise. If they",Bogus-Ava-the-Pit

We should definitely pm each other. I like meeting new people over shared interests 🥲 I will say it’s unfair how we are treated verses the way MCU fans are treated. They legit get away with making marvel their entire personality and belittling anyone who thinks the Batman is better (which it is but that’s beyond the point, haha) and no one bullies them. I’m not saying anyone deserves to be bullied because truth is no one deserves to be bullied but like, we get so much shit for showing the slightest interest in twilight but MCU Stans can be toxic about marvel and they get away with it.., so unfair 🫠",xeternallylostx

Unfortunately, there isn’t any place really where you can find any of them cheap. Your best bet is going to be finding an auction on eBay where the starting price is on the lower side of the spectrum. If you’re willing to wait it out, you can just give it time until the hype around them dies. They only started selling from $300-$600 a few months ago. I believe we have a tiktok to thank for the insane popularity and price increase, as well as the twilight renaissance and the release of Midnight Sun in general as OG Twihards and newer generation fans alike are diving back into the world of Bella Swan. This plus the current trend that is buying records has a lot of collectors messed up with the prices and whatnot since people buying them now either don’t know how to spend money on a record OR they don’t give a fuck and drop whatever on one because of how badly they want one. I’d strongly suggest waiting it out, I finished right before the demand skyrocketed and I paid retail price for several of them. Don’t hurt your bank account, haha.",fieryspirit11

I was reading the Illustrated Guide, which has a lot of extra information regarding the saga yesterday, and Meyer was saying that the beginnings are quite open ended and close as the characters make decisions, which is true. 

Though I'm curious about what you mean by this:

>The plots probably have enough holes to be made of swiss cheese. The characters do stupid things.

The books are almost completely different as the films miss a lot of things out, and most of the ""plot holes"" can probably be explained through those.

Lastly, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Most of the people saying they hate it probably have never actually sat down and watched it or given it a chance and I'm glad you have. They're rainy day comfort films for a lot of us.",DeadDeathrocker

I both read the books and watched the movies.  No, the books will not be considered classic literature in 100 years from now, and yes, the writing did have its not so great moments, but........  

Stephanie Meyer captured something that is sadly lacking in our society and I think that is what makes this series so special.  She captured the concepts of caring for family so deeply that one would do anything for them.  She captured a love (between Edward and Bella) so strong that it was unbelievable for many people.  There were comments everywhere about how the story was unbelievable because there was no such thing as a love like that.  ""How could anyone possibly have a love like that?"".  But that's just it, these people were wrong......

I am close to 70 years old now.  My late husband loved this series as much as my son and I did at the time.  He would watch it with us several times before we lost him to a sudden stroke in 2009.  He and I had a love like that.  We were soulmates and I think that that is why we could relate to these movies so much.......   We felt it too.....

I though the first one fast corny AF, the second is still my least favorite for the sole reason that I can't stand Bella being miserable, the 3rd is my all time favorite because of the plot and the backstories we get. I love the tension hand hard decisions of BD1 and the outside vampires from BD2 ! 

But then this year I finally read the books, fell in love with them, which pretty much ruined the movies because of all the things that were added or removed or moved around in the storyline... Except for Eclipse, which is imo the most accurate...",Llewellyn26

The characters doing stupid things is like Edward wanting to kill himself after hearing “maybe” Bella is dead. Like, dude, take a minute and check it out. Alice was already there, why not call her to confirm if his suspicions were true? And there were other moments like those.",neweveryday7

e4fmgq,Why Does the Twilight Saga Make Me so Emotional?,f9a9ddx,2019-12-01 11:35:46,"That makes two of us. I am 24-year-old guy and twilight is the best movie franchise for me. I don't know how many times I read the books and how many times I've watched the movies. In hindsight, the movies and the books aren't that great but I love them so much. I connect so much to the characters and whenever I watch the movies, I feel very nostalgic and I generally have a great experience. Also, the ending of breaking dawn puts me to tears every time. When Alice has a vision and then the songs start ''all my lovers surround me, like virgins clean today.."", which is a song by  POP ETC. Also the theme song where they feature all the characters and actors. Whenever I watch it now, I just skip the last two parts because I just become emotionally overwhelmed and I'm a guy so that makes me a bit uncomfortable. I think the reason why I connect to this movie so much is that I've always loved the idea of being immortal and having that one person that is willing to do everything and anything to be with you. All in all, I will never tire of watching the movies and I can't wait to watch them in a few months or years from now.",SubSahranCamelRider

Not to get too deep, but when I was diagnosed with depression, watching the movies and reading the books helped me escape. Just for a little while, I could focus on those characters instead of myself. 

I still cry every time at the ending credits of Breaking Dawn Part 2.",ohnothebanjo

e4fmgq,Why Does the Twilight Saga Make Me so Emotional?,fqke4aw,2020-05-14 03:03:02,"hi lol i know this is a very late comment but i would just like to add:)) i’m 14 years old, just turned 14 April 23rd. when twilight came out i was 2 years old. i only first watched it when i was 6 years old. all though i didn’t really understand a thing, it was still my favourite movie. even when i was a little kid. i would watch it everyday for almost a whole year, and every time i would finish the series i would be already so excited to watch it again the next day. i totally forgot about the series until i reached high school. i remember seeing a post about it on Instagram so i decided to watch the whole series in 2 days and when i tell you i balled my eyes out. i balled my eyes out. especially at the end of breaking dawn part 2, when bella and edward are in the field and she showed him a short montage of their story. at first i never knew why i would cry so i would always search up on the internet other people’s reviews and opinions on the whole series. so many people say it’s very emotional for them because they went through a serious heartbreak and think of their past relationship when watching twilight, or in ur case the feeling of never being able to find a edward or jacob (not including the fact that they’re immortal lol). but i’ve never felt a heartbreak before nor someone important in my life leaving. it took me months to try and find out why i would always get to emotional towards the series. i finally found out why.. i miss my childhood. when everything was perfect and i was happy. i know it might sound crazy because it has nothing to do with the twilight series but it has everything to do with me. because when i used to watch the series as a little girl, i was always happy and had nothing to worry about. but now i’m a 14 year old teenager being stressed over getting below a 70% because it could ruin my whole future on who i want to be, even though i really do try my hardest. i know that’s probably the least sad thing ever but i just wanted to say that even if i’m 14 and never experienced heartbreak, we all have a different reason to be emotional on something (in this case the series). i would just also like to add that the whole twilight soundtrack is AMAZING loool:))",xMelonGlamx

e4fmgq,Why Does the Twilight Saga Make Me so Emotional?,kskdhik,2024-02-28 17:44:57,"I think I know, we are instinctively searching for our other half, for a family. And I feel like the people who relate with twilight the most are teenagers (very emotional changes happening during that time), people who feel like they’re the odd one out or people who lack confidence, or maybe everyone really.. When we see someone like bella (clumsy, a bit anti social, going through a lot of emotions where she doesn’t feel content with herself) meet someone perfect like edward, who cares for her and protects her no matter what, and the cullen family who are as sweet and welcoming and protective as Edward. Bella goes through a big evolution where she goes from a uhappy uncontent human girl to a vampire with a family and a mate who unconditionally loves her. Its all most of us really want.. aaanddd the visuals the primal feel, the MUSICC aaah it just makes the twilight saga a complete nostalgic and emotional ride. Also it forms as an escape for us. Because we know what we get from watching the movies so it gives us a sense of controle and fill up that gap for a time..

It resonated so much.  

I also love the idea of unconditional love and immortality and I'm in my late thirties so it just goes to show how this series can cross all ages, genders, and just about everyone.  It's a love story,  a good vs evil story but it is so so much more. The characters could be you or me just going about our lives and then we meet him or her...

But with the recent Twilight Renaissance, who knows maybe they'll finally go forward with the series again.
