At the time of its release in 2011, I did rank it as my #1 favorite, but I've struggled over the years between picking P4 or P3: At World's End taking the top spot. But overall, I'm very happy you enjoy the film enough to say it might be your favorite.

>blackbeard wasn't that of a thrill, but they did capture his evilness very very well.

Does ""Mutineers...HANG!"" mean nothing to you? Haha Bad joke aside, totally agree. It was indeed hard to like Blackbeard as much (or more) as Davy Jones who is the superior villain. But as producer Jerry Bruckheimer said, Blackbeard is the most evil character they ever gave us. Yes, the other villains are better (with Barbossa being the first to kill his own men, i.e. shooting Pintel in the chest to see if the Aztec curse was lifted) but Blackbeard did do some things that were arguably just as evil, such as ""loving"" his daughter only to ""kill"" her.

>But my god what made me love this movie so much was the mermaids scene,

Yeah, the general consensus is that the mermaids were the best thing about the film. But with that being said, nothing topped Davy Jones for me. And I'm speaking P2-3 Jones, not the nonsensical shadowy silhouette we see in P5.

>I didn't mind that Will or Elizabeth weren't in the movie, and I loved seeing Jack not overpowered as I felt they would fall into that mistake like many writers do after a character becomes loveable.

I could go on about how I was happy with P4 being a post-Trilogy film that respected the ending to Will and Elizabeth's story enough to leave it be...but I won't, because it's obvious. I understand some fans wanted it, but their appearance in P5 was disappointing in more ways than one, but that's another debate entirely.

Jack is more or less overpowered. Yeah, he got shanghaied aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, led a failed mutiny aboard the ship, or in other words pretty much dragged across this quest for the Fountain of Youth. That said, Jack is as powerful as Bugs Bunny, which they kind of referenced in some of his shenanigans in the film(s).

>All in all I'm genuinely interested on why it's low rated, it felt like it at least takes second place out of the trilogy

Someone once wrote, not exact words but summarizing, that P4 is exactly what you need from a post-trilogy installment of the franchise. The direction, however, not so much ... though in fairness, it was in comparison and appreciation for what Gore Verbinski did. Personally, I'm torn. I understand that P1-3 were peak POTC, but that doesn't make P4 a terrible film. If nothing else, if it's not obvious, I consider P4 a better post-Trilogy film than P5. P4 had more new stuff (recycled soundtrack notwithstanding) whereas P5 copied far, FAR too much from the previous films (including an even more recycled soundtrack), which outweighed any freshness it brought, among other issues, i.e. continuity issues.",CJS-JFan

1. Agreed. Zombies were so different (and better) from concept art. Even Miles Teves was disappointed that they never got past his concepts, even the Black Caesar zombie.
2. Somewhat, only because of one missed opportunity. As much as I like the scene in Palm Tree Grove between Jack and Barbossa, I feel P4 would have benefited more from a flashback scene of Blackbeard capturing the Pearl, though I'm sure it would add more to the already large budget the film reportedly had. Otherwise, I'm mostly okay with the film as is as far as the battles, with one or two changes, i.e. choreography. As far as sea battles, I do count Jack's mutiny as a sea battle and was far from disappointed. Even the arguably disappointing HMS Providence vs Spanish galleons, which again I'm fine with, but they shouldn't have shown the crew ""preparing the cannons for battle"" when there was no battle to be had. There is a difference between not spoiling and false advertising, which I think they did worse for P5 by hyping up Will Turner for a two-scene cameo role. Smh
3. Somewhat, only because we're basing POTC timeline with the real timeline, but even then it's hard to argue about a fictionalized universe. Until DMTNT, which added more confusion drastically, we had a more simple one year here, a few months there, a few years there...oh and twenty years have passed between, hey wait a minute!

>Everything else was good. Blackbeard was pure evil, Angelica was a pirate through and through, mermaids were terrifying and awesome, Captain Jack was... well, Captain Jack, and Barbossa was the greatest mastermind of all time. His ""Are we not king's men?"" speech is one of my favorite scenes in the entire series. He's a great and inspiring leader both as a pirate and a Royal Navy officer.

Everything else was good...again, speaking as fellow fan who loves this film, I may contradict this comment by saying not everything was good. The most egregious criticism, in my opinion, is the soundtrack which could have been better than it was. Not to say it would fix all the film's problems, but one could at least say the soundtrack was more than ""POTC's best hits with few new"" though I suppose that's more deserving for P5, which I don't think has many (if any) new themes other than Salazar's theme, which I think is mostly a ripoff of Blackbeard's theme. At least P4 had the Spanish, Mermaids, Angelica (though didn't play the whole thing onscreen), and again Blackbeard.

Other than that, totally agree. Some fans argue Captain Jack wasn't barely the Captain Jack we know, I'd argue much differently. I understand most of fans' criticisms about Blackbeard, but I quite enjoyed Mr. Beard even in comparison to past characters (i.e. Davy Jones), and speaking to some of the more critical of the character, [Terry Rossio delivered a great argument for the character on Wordplay](http://www.wordplayer.com/forums/scriptsarc16/index.cgi?read=190749), like it or hate it, agreed or not. Angelica is certainly underrated, and I wish we saw more of her outside of being a meet and greet character at Disney, unless she's reduced to only appearing in the [Magic Kingdom's Halloween parade](https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Mickey%27s_Boo-to-You_Halloween_Parade).

Easily, the thing that all fans agreed on: Mermaids and Barbossa were the best of P4. I've seen God knows how many fans say that the mermaid battle at Whitecap Bay was the best scene of the film, which I won't argue much with. Barbossa once again showed what a great character he is, especially in comparison to Captain Jack. Especially when you find out the lengths he went into getting his revenge, as well as gaining a new ship and the sword which controls it...sadly we never got to see the full details behind that. But all in all, it did make him a very capable pirate. ""Are we not king's men?"" is definitely a great scene, and certainly inspiring.",CJS-JFan

I think it can be argued that peak Jack Sparrow is in the original film P1. But I enjoyed him in P2-3, and indeed he stood fairly well in P4, warts and all. P5, well...it was a step down. But yeah, Jack's adventures in London were indeed legendary - impersonating a judge, planning his escape seconds before meeting King George, and facing an impostor.

* One zombie aka the Quartermaster is one who ""can see things before they happen"" and yet we never really see much about that ability outside of a mention or two. Only that we're supposed to believe him about Blackbeard's death by a one-legged man. Which is mostly a nitpick here, but still.
* The Cook, who was one of the human crewman that Jack Sparrow recruits in a mutiny aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, was killed by Blackbeard's Greek fire. However, unbeknownst to the more casual fans, we were supposed to see the Cook return as a zombie, which sadly was cut from the film. Taken from the scene in Blackbeard's cabin while Mr. Beard tortures Jack with the voodoo doll: *-- CLOSE ON: the Cook, standing in the doorway, STARING at him. A Zombie, like the others. He smiles. The Quartermaster puts a hand on his shoulder, leads him off.*

They don't have to be rotting corpses like the cursed crew of TCotBP, because that would be too similar, but there are still ways to make them far scarier than they ended up being. Just watch Romero's original Dawn of the Dead and learn what makes the walking corpses scary. Pale skin, unnaturally slow movement, blank staring, worms coming out of their wounds, etc. Good practical effects are all you need. Gray face make-up is cheaper than CGI. That could even turn into a great shocking scene during the mutiny on the Revenge, when the humans rise against the zombies and the undead suddenly become much more animated, fighting with the same speed like normal humans. Also, their lips have to be sewn shut, like in Powers' novel, so their souls can't leave their (un)dead bodies. That could also create a mystery - how did the quartermaster predict Blackbeard's death if he can't speak?

Hmm, I'm torn. On the one hand, I was kind of okay with the idea that Quartermaster and Gunner being able to speak as they were the main officers, and as far as I'm aware none of the other zombies spoke so that could have been fine enough. And yet, I could see that being a running gag that could have brought some humor. Dark humor, but humor nonetheless.

Also, although I think to make the zombies slow but then ""surprise"" us by moving at normal speed could work, but we would have had to focus on the zombies and their movement more than one scene. And with more than one or two zombies. I think prior to the mutiny, we were only properly introduced to Quartermaster and Gunner, but even then, they were exactly well-presented. Though I guess it's due to us focusing more on Jack's predicament of being imprisoned aboard Blackbeard's ship, but still, that was one casualty of the film's shorter running time.",CJS-JFan

The idea of a ship that is controlled by sword is and also has built in flamethrower was awesome and I wish they utilised more. While DMTNT just had another Dutchman but could eat things, but the film had better designs for the crew then OST. 

Also a big one is that Jack act a bit more like himself and tries to add more to his past, while DMTNT just rehashed Jacks backstory with a cool naval fight (mainly because of the bootleg) but completely changes the way Jack gains a defining item, his compass. The next one is major continuity errors with the previous films like how Jack gives away his compass multiple times throughout and it’s a major plot point Jack gives away his compass to summon Salazar. Also Jack becoming a penniless drunk is so annoying when he has everything tailored for him: he has the gratitude of a god, has a love hate relationship with three great captains (Turner, Barbossa, Elizabeth), a whole fleet of ships and the E.I.T.C obviously fears him as would the Royal Navy.

I’m not saying OST is a perfect movie like it’s predecessors but I am saying DMTNT is a worse film in most regards and seemed to just be Disney milking the franchise especially with Depp being at such a low point.",Steam_Drunk

piratesofthecaribbean,pwfw7c,On Stranger Tides doesn’t feel right,hf6hnyk,2021-10-03 03:06:37,"It isn’t supposed to have similar plots or storylines but just a bunch of different mystical pirates tales. I totally agree with you about this movie, but at least Johny Depp always does a good job with jack sparrow regardless. It appears to me that Jack Sparrow is always trying to find ways to make him immortal to allow him to sail the seas forever perhaps or just to cheat death which is actually really cool in my honest opinion. I like the aztec gold curse the most even with its negative effects. I want to see someone in the future who discovered the lost cursed pirate gold to be introduced into the story line. I think the island called Isla de Muerta supposedly got submerged or “reclaimed by the sea” but if there was a way for the person to retrieve the coins underwater that would be cool.

I do like Angelica and Scrum and the missionary, but it just feels like the family is split apart y'know? Makes the movie feel a bit empty.

2. Blackbeard. Now don't get me wrong, Ian McShane is awesome, but I feel like Blackbeard slowly loses intimidation as the movie goes on. His introduction during the mutiny is fantastic, but once you see him on land in daylight, he kinda just comes across as a cruel old man--which makes sense given his sadistic nature and his hunt for the Fountain of Youth!--but he just doesn't have as grand a presence as Barbossa or Jones.

Blackbeard was a wasted villain, especially wasting a talent like Ian McShane. And my primary issue is with Jack Sparrow. The plot revolves entirely around him. Jack doesn’t work well as the primary protagonist. The character works best as part of an ensemble, as seen in the initial trilogy. Depp can carry a movie but Jack as a character can’t. And the plot kinda negates the third film. Sparrow wants to live forever, be the last pirate. That’s why he considers stabbing Davy Jones’s heart. But in the end he has a change of heart (no pun intended) thanks to his internal struggle, Barbossa’s advice of passing on his legacy, and the fact that Will was dying. But in OST, he’s on the chase for the fountain of youth. And yeah, I get the end of AWE alluded to him going on a quest for it but that should’ve been it. It was a fun ending but made for a bad plot for an entire sequel.",Tbhjr

It kind of went against the grain compared to the first three.


In the first three, you had a love triangle that played just as much an important role in the film as the main plot itself.  The two intertwined like all the fibers of the ropes used for the rigging of the sails of the *Black Pearl, Interceptor,* or any other ship.


Also in the first three, you not only had a single antagonist, but you had multiple antagonists.  You had the entire crew of the *Black Pearl* in the first film, not just Barbossa.  You were rooting for both Jack and for the East India Trading Company.  In the second and third ones, your loyalty shifted solely to Jack, Elizabeth, and Will, when it's revealed the EITC is the real antagonist.  While Davy Jones is also a major antagonist, he's really just a small piece of driftwood in the vast sea.  It's not until he's basically press-ganged into working with the EITC in the third one does he become more dangerous, but what's different here is you actually feel sorry for him.  He's basically being held hostage by the EITC with Lord Beckett and Mr. Mercer at the helm.


The last two felt more like Indiana Jones movies than POTC movies.  In both cases you only had one antagonist, though quite deadly, were easy to dispose of.  You had a McGuffin in both movies (the Fountain of Youth/two chalices in the fourth; Trident of Poseidon in the fifth) that, while powerful, was easily destroyed.  And last, you had a love story that felt more like an afterthought.  While the characters alone were pivotal to the overall plots of their respective movies (although I question Phillip's role), them falling in love wasn't really that necessary.",PatrickRsGhost

A still-living Blackbeard with supernatural powers, ships in bottles, voodoo dolls, a sword used to control ships (revealed to originate from a sapphire/pearl with the power to rule the winds), and of course mermaids. Yeah, sure, P4 did not have a lot of content. Frankly, a better argument would be that the film had too much material, not enough runtime to help to expand the universe. For the record, P4 is the second shortest, with P5 being the shortest.

Regarding how dark it was, yeah, I can't say I disagree there. I want to say blame the decision to film P4 in 3-D as it was the first film (I think) to do so on more tropical locations rather than a studio like Avatar did.",CJS-JFan

>Missing most the original cast. I know Will and Elizabeth completed their arcs but their absence is felt for me. (Not to mention crewmates like Pintel and Ragetti.) I do like Angelica and Scrum and the missionary, but it just feels like the family is split apart y'know? Makes the movie feel a bit empty.

Not so much that their arcs were complete (which is true until P5 happened) but consider into your calculations that Orlando and Keira made it clear they were done with the franchise after P3, and it even shows in P5. Will was overhyped in trailers, D23 Expo announcements, etc only for the character to a cameo role. Same with Elizabeth, which I find more insulting due to the character having zero lines in her already-small role, which is makes it worse considering the fact that the original writers considered Elizabeth to be the protagonist of the story - though obviously at this point Jack Sparrow is the main character of the franchise, but hopefully you get my point. The only reason we saw those two again were for one reason only: $$. And it shows.

Pintel and Ragetti is a bit more complicated as they were considered for P4 and 5, according to behind the scenes information. According to a [post Terry Rossio made on Wordplay](http://www.wordplayer.com/archives/rossio10.Sail.Tide.html), their story in P4 was discarded by director Rob Marshall, with the fair excuse of the possibility of their roles being cut. P5 is a stranger one, due to the return of other Black Pearl crewmembers, and the fact that both characters were featured in early screenplays by Terry Rossio in 2012, and later ones with Jeff Nathanson in 2013, only to be cut by the time filming began in 2015. I'm sure the fact that Mackenzie Crook decided to not return in order to focus in his TV series [*Detectorists*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detectorists), but Arenberg  was totally game.

>His introduction during the mutiny is fantastic, but once you see him on land in daylight, he kinda just comes across as a cruel old man

That's one criticism I can kind of understand. Given the fact that he had a sword which he uses to control ships, yet also (albeit unconfirmed until a hypothetical P5) holds the power to rule the wind, Blackbeard would have been better off staying aboard his ship. Chances are, Barbossa and the Providence crew would be more worried about their rigging than the mermaids...okay, that one is a bit of a stretch.

I don't exactly know what would have made Blackbeard in the film better, since there has been a [compelling argument by Rossio, again on Wordplay](http://www.wordplayer.com/forums/scriptsarc16/index.cgi?read=190749). One comment made basically said that the film was good on paper, but the direction could've been better, which I think can be agreed upon. I don't think Rob Marshall did terrible, but neither he nor Ronning and Sandberg gave their films the same love and care that Gore Verbinski gave the original trilogy, each flawed in their own way.",CJS-JFan

Not a bad movie it's still fun, but I understand why many find it lackluster in content.

I will say that the mandates the studios tried to push into the film didn't exactly help, or in some ways director Rob Marshall. In the final cut of the film we got to see the Cook killed by Blackbeard's Greek fire, but had we seen the story in full, we could have been able to see the Cook's fate to return as a zombie officer - a scene that was ultimately not filmed due to it being ""too scary for a Disney film"" supposedly. Or for those who know the lore inside-out can see Jack give Angelica the ring stolen from Tia Dalma's shack and know the story behind it, even though it's a mostly small reference. It even hurts to miss out on some killer lines of dialogue, like Barbossa to Jack aboard Ponce de Leon's ship the Santiago: *""See there, I've learnt my lesson about taking treasure from a place, not knowing what curse might lie upon it.""*

Not saying that either scenes or character-based moments would make the film better, but it's stuff like that could make an interesting film. Or at least have the diehard fans like it more.",CJS-JFan

1.

2.

Regardless, I think the Fountain was done better than the zombies, which I think are an unforgivable sin. That is a case where the designs used in the concept art should have been used.",CJS-JFan

But the problem there was that we never really have the sense of the zombie officers being actual zombies other than the moment that the Quartermaster was stabbed and was still living.

While we did have aforementioned references through the zombies and voodoo dolls, which did expand the universe a bit, but we never really got to explore the Haitian vodou beliefs. Which even then supposedly POTC does a fictional take on voodoo that offends people who follow said beliefs.

Personally I would have been more intrigued had they kept certain elements from the screenplay, like how the zombies had frozen eyeballs, which we never see much outside the trailers. Perhaps better show the Quartermaster's power as the eleri ipin who can see things before they happen. And of course, the more or less known fact that the Cook was killed by Blackbeard's Greek fire and then brought back as a zombie, the latter moment cut supposedly because it was ""too scary"" for a Disney film.",CJS-JFan

That was one of the weakest parts of At World's End imho, feeling like they were smashing too much Jack in when it wasn't really his story. 

 OST had a lot of really strong beats to it, as well as great performances from Ian McShane, Sam Claflin, and Astrid Berges-Frisbey. Depp's chemistry with Geoffrey Rush and Penelope Cruz is very apparent here, and really helps support the film. Sure, it has some pacing issues, and some elements seem tired and reused (""Zombified,"" anyone?), but it also has some excellent execution of mystical elements that could have easily fallen flat.

But to keep it short, OST lacks good writing just as much as DMTNT. The film spells everything out to the viewer, a problem that vexes a lot of films these days due to short attention-spans, that there's nothing for the viewer to come to his own conclusions of. 

The main difference for me, however, is that unlike DMTNT, OST tries to work with new concepts in some capacity and it doesn't complicate the timeline or the lore of the franchise a lot.

piratesofthecaribbean,1jp5ezm,"Genuine Question, Why Is On Stranger Tides So Hated?",mky891m,2025-04-02 00:52:23,"Genuine answer, P4-5 suffer from being compared to Gore Verbinski's trilogy. The ensemble cast, the sets, the CGI, the score, the world-building, and general filmmaking that may never happen again. But whether one likes it or not, they did deliver on the original wishes of Verbinski, which was to *""start fresh and focus on the further adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow.""* Granted, he was more recently quoted as saying making more films was ""financial"" as a reason why he didn't return to the director's chair, but I digress. Rob Marshall is hardly Verbinski, given he omitted one scene in P4 being ""it's too scary for a Disney movie,"" as well as the lack of care that P5 filmmakers Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg had with the original lore.

And sure, P4 is flawed, but I still enjoyed it. Blackbeard was not as great a villain as Barbossa or Davy Jones, but it isn't as bad as most fans make it out to be. While I understand why Will and Elizabeth were missed by most fans, you have to understand that Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley made it clear they were done with the series, with their cameo roles P5 being the most proof of that, and at best, I'd say they were the main characters of the original trilogy now that Disney made Jack Sparrow the main character of the series through their books, video games, theme park attractions, etc. So, yeah...new characters with new storylines seemed the most sensible direction for a post-trilogy film, but the problem is you either had a poor choice in a new director or writer, which I think both P4-5 suffered.

Jack's getting his own solo spotlight so to speak. His own mission to discover self enlightenment, the lesson his father warned him about ; that the chalice's will test his moral and spiritual strength. I actually loved it. And the best is Barbossa and Gibbs being back in action. And the deepening bromance between Jack and Barbossa is hilariously amazing. 

And for once, none of that romance drama between Will and Elizabeth. I love the ENTIRE series, but I was getting REALLY bored with those two. I don't hate, but immensely bored.

However I do understand people's criticisms, and I have my own

My view on the film is that it feels far too small, contained and simple compared to the rest. It feels more like a potc 3.5. For all the problems 5 has, it at least recaptures the grand atmosphere and world like the first 3 did and connects a lot of things back up

4 is very isolated, it's like a Jack Sparrow spin-off and a stop-gap in the main aspect of the story linking 3 and 5 

To put it yet another way, we always hear about off screen adventures Jack has been on. And that's what the film feels like. Some off screen lore that has been visualised. It just doesn't really fit in with the other installments

Think about which events in 4 actually has any meaning in the wider storytelling. Barbossa losing The Pearl, claiming The Queen Anne's Revenge, and Jack getting his hands on the bottled Pearl. All of which could be explained and explored during 5, because The Pearl never actually returns in 4, there's nothing much that's been achieved",FKez05

DMTNT is dumb as hell but it has an enjoyable villain and the flashback sequence is a highlight of the whole franchise, though it also has some issues. 

On Stranger Tides just doesn’t really offer much. Even most of the music is just recycled pieces from the first three films.",austinb172
piratesofthecaribbean,1jp5ezm,"Genuine Question, Why Is On Stranger Tides So Hated?",mkx8qie,2025-04-01 21:23:31,"It's when these movies started to feel a bit rote, and like the filmmakers/Disney were more interested in checking the ""stuff that goes into a Pirates of the Caribbean movie"" rather than making a good story in its own right.

It's writing is lacking compared to the first three. The characters don't deliver exposition in a way that feels natural. For example:

>**Blackbeard:** *Ah, there I be again, forgetting why the missionary was here. My daughter fears for my soul, or what's left of it. You truly wish to save me, my child.*

I know this sounds like a nitpick, but one of my biggest pet peeves in a movie is when characters are plainly saying something for the audience's benefit even if everyone already involved in the conversation already knows the information being delivered. It just immediately takes me out of the movie, and OST does this a couple times and it drives me up the wall.

I also think OST (and DMTNT, but that's another thread) really suffer from not having Gore Verbinski as director. Verbinski kinda comes from the George Lucas school of ""fantasy universes should look dirty and lived in,"" and he achieves that in his three *Pirates* movies. In this one, though, the visual style is more akin to what would become the ""Disney live action blockbuster"" look. There's a level of fakeness to the visuals that you don't get in the first three, and all of the costumes look clean by comparison to the first three. And in general you just really feel the lack of Verbinski's madcap energy.

And also, the score for this movie is terrible. It's one thing to reuse themes from prior movies (it's to be expected from a franchise like this), but it's another thing entirely to reuse entire cues from the prior movies, especially when your using them in a context that just doesn't make sense. For example, in the London chase sequence you hear the version of Davy Jones' Theme as chase music from the scene where the *Dutchman* chases the *Black Pearl* in DMC; you hear the EITC Theme when Jack fights Angelica for some reason. Zimmer just completely phoned this one in.",Trambopoline96

The crew of the Pearl is pretty much down to just Jack and Gibbs, and they spend a lot of the movie separate from each other. Elizabeth and Will are missing too. The most iconic villains in the franchise have exited stage right and now new boots need to be filled. In my mind back then, if the ensemble feeling of DMC/AWE wasn’t there anymore, it wasn’t a proper POTC flick. 

As an adult, I can respect that they tried to do something new but they really failed to capture that Verbinski magic. Blackbeard is trying wayyy too hard to be the next Davy Jones. He has a sword that can control his ship, voodoo zombies, and flamethrowers. It’s too much and the actor doesn’t have the charisma or gravity to deliver. Everything that comes out of his mouth feels so by the numbers and generic. The Spaniard manages to be a better villain with the sparse screentime he has imo and he’s honestly the only new thing I like in the whole movie. Syrena and Philip are fun characters on their own but their whole romance subplot is the most hamfisted load of young adult novel garbage I’ve ever seen.

Bringing back my favorite character, Barbossa, made it even better.

However, while I do love it, I still think it’s the weakest in the series. Apart from the mermaid attack, the action sequences were dull compared to the other films. The first movie had the stunning underwater skeletons and naval combats, the second featured cages, the wheel, and the kraken, the third had a literal maelstrom, and even the fifth showcased ghost sharks and the sea splitting. But the fourth? Just uninspired sword fighting. Blackbeard has a sword that controls a fire-breathing ship, and they did barely anything with it.

I just found it incredibly boring. The pacing, the editing, the direction, there's just something about the end product which fails to grab me.

Gore Verbinski's trilogy was just so phenomenally made. Everything was fun and engaging, it delivered on the horror elements, the romantic moments, the fun little character moments and the thrill of the action adventure elements. It was snappy whilst giving the moments that needed it time to breathe.

OST however just doesn't deliver the same. When I watched it, I was consciously aware that I should be enjoying myself but I just wasn't. I wasn't engaged with it at all, and I was a massive POTC fan in my teenage years so I was completely ready to dive back into that world.

I think most of the hate on P4 was due to the new elements, or rather the near complete abandonment of almost every element of the trilogy everyone liked in P1-3, such as Will and Elizabeth, or I'd argue the characters people really missed, Pintel and Ragetti. There are some other points, some being fairly solid, depending on the subject in question, but of course film is subjective and everyone has their personal tastes.

Me personally, I liked the film enough to consider it my #1 favorite POTC film for a time. However, it did go down after a few rewatches of all five films. Ultimately, for now anyway, I do still consider it my second favorite, with P3 taking the top spot for me, but I still like P4 quite alot.

>Zombies: raised by dark magic, controlled by Blackbeard. They weren't the stereotypical slow, rotting ones, nor skeletons, and I appreciated that.

I like the zombies, but even fans who like the film may say the zombies didn't feel like zombies, which I can see because these were more like thugs with zombie makeup and tattoos rather than real zombies. For me, I am still bummed that we never got to see the Cook that Blackbeard killed with Greek fire return as a zombie, an omission made because director Rob Marshall said it was ""too scary for a Disney film""...sigh. Another one element that kinda ruins the lore, at least for me, is that the zombies were supposed to die as Blackbeard died...which I guess is still implied in the final cut of the film, given we don't see zombies under Barbossa, but still.

Other than that, the zombies didn't entirely ruin the film for me.

>**Cool swordfights, adventure:** there were plenty of this as well. The mass-fight at the end and the Barbossa vs Blackbeard maybe wasn't as long or cool as the other duels in other episodes, but it was still cool.

I'll be surprised if I see anyone say Barbossa vs Blackbeard was not a good idea. Some may argue it is due to the storyline that Barbossa is a privateer rather than a pirate, but I think that is moot. My issue with it is that we mainly see the stunt doubles and don't have enough shots of Geoffrey Rush and Ian McShane; yes, it may make the fight less interesting in some respect, but at the same time, part of the movie magic is knowing the actors put their full effort into the scene in question.

>Barbossa made a deal with the english navy, and betrayed the pirates. Meanwhile, he just considered them as a tool not as an ally, and ultimately, betrayed the navy as well.

We have some idea of what Barbossa did in his time with the British, but nothing really definitive as far as a part in betraying the pirates beyond Jack and Gibbs, or being a pirate hunter. All we know for sure is that Barbossa used the British for his goal of revenge against Blackbeard, and claiming his sword that controls the ship, as payment for his missing leg and the sinking of the Black Pearl. Some may take issue with this particular storyline and claim it isn't ""in character"" but one may argue the opposite as Barbossa has played his role as a capable pirate in the film as he would in almost every other film.

>The lore was expanding. The **music was phenomenal**. The movie could show something new in literally every parts, wheter it was a legend, a character, or a location, or a monster.

The one thing that we may disagree on, however, the music. Now I do like P4 music more than P5, but I will say that both films suffer from overusage of recycled music for their soundtrack. But I'd argue P4 had a more original feeling than P5, but the same could be said the other way around or so I'm told. Still, to this day I hate whoever made the decision to have the Davy Jones' theme play in London, which does not work at all. That said, I think my favorite track was ""Mutiny"" which is mostly recycled music, which probably may not work for some, but I was fine with it myself.

The lore...it is a finicky subject, depending, but for me P4's lore is mostly in relation to P5. There was some stuff introduced that didn't exactly continue on, or play out as originally intended, whether they make an appearance or not. For instance, the fate of Philip and Syrena at the end of P4 is more questionable the end of P3 with Will and Elizabeth - ignoring P5 stuff in this instance, for the sake of argument. My biggest issue is the retcon-yet-not about the powers behind Blackbeard's Sword of Triton, which technically isn't contradictory in P4 but rather P5, but basically all of its power is related to the wind and the ship AND has zero relations with Blackbeard's methods in creating ships in bottles.",CJS-JFan

Ian McShane is a fantastic actor, and I can’t think of an actor better suited to play Blackbeard. I thought his powers were cool and he had potential. But for some reason, something was just lacking.

OST has little to no cultural impact. The only thing people remember this movie for is the Spanish somewhat being the good guys. I could say Davy Jones or Kraken and everyone thinks of DMC or AWE. 

Blackbeard is poorly acted in my opinion. He lacks the gravitas that Beckett, Jones, and even Mercer had. To confound this further the writers constantly try to one up everything so he’s a better Jones. He’s got voodoo zombies that are barely explained, voodoo dolls, flamethrowers on his ship, a magic sword that can control his ship, he can shrink boats, etc. 

The mermaids are alright I guess. I suppose it is nice to see a departure from their mainstream depiction. But Syrena is a terrible character and she’s the main one out of the bunch. She falls in love with some guy because he’s nice to her? It’s pretty clearly shown a good chunk of the crew weren’t malevolent towards the mermaids and they got slaughtered anyways.

I think Jack realized, partially because of these senteces, partially beacuse of Blackbeard's obsession: eternal life is not necessarily a blessing. Especially not in this way, because the Fountain required quite a lot of preparations.

Also, it wasn't entirely pointless: the map was used to find the Fountain, which was shown in the 3rd part's end. It just literally continued.

The biggest issue is that it's ""stuck"" with Jack as the main character, when he worked much better as a foil to Will and Elizabeth (who had some actual developments), and the movie can't really commit to having him as a main character, so he sort of ends up lacking motivation, yet they still have to tie him *a bit* to the plot, so it mostly ends up feeling muddled. It also means that we have other people who sort of become the main characters, but as we've just been introduced to them, it's hard to really care. Which also makes it very overstuffed.

It suffered from the ""following the ending"" problem too, where having to follow a big finale meant that the stakes now had to match that, so it was harder to make a smaller story (which would likely have worked better).

One of the things I thought about when I saw it was that it felt like it would have worked better if Jack had *less* motivation; if he had *just* been motivated to try and get back the Black Pearl, it might been a stronger story. That way, they could have leaned into Jack's devil-may-care attitude more, but also make him an audience surrogate, confused about these other people and their motivation and quest he's involved with now by having to get back his ship.

Blackbeard wasn't unkillable at all, there was a literal prophecy about his death. And if it wouldn't be Barbossa's stab AND poison, the magical waster was also deadly to him.

The story about him swimming around the ship without his head might have been just a legend. Also, why would he be controlled by Davy Jones, or Salazar's crew?

Davy Jones's task was to take care about those who died on the sea - to take them to the otherworld. He NEGLECTED his duty - and those who served him and we know about or saw, made the deal with him while they were still alive.

When Jones appeared first in the 2nd movie, he was only offering a deal to already captured or dying people, never to ghosts or souls. Will's father took the deal in a ""living"" state, because the curse of the aztec gold didn't allow him to die. The random crewmen of the ship where Will meets Jones were alive too, and Will took the deal as well, and he was ALIVE AS WELL. Jones tried to take Norrington's soul as well, after he was stabbed - but even at that moment, Norrington was STILL ALIVE!

Which means I think:

1. Jones didn't recruit dead people. He could only do it with dying or living ones, and as for the souls, he only ""escorted"" them.
2. Jones didn't take every souls he could. Why would he do that? He could teleport for sure, for a distance, but he couldn't appear everywhere in the same time. He didn't have unlimited place on his ship, nor he needed thousands on men on called ship.

5. As for why wasn't Blackbeard at the court? Well, that's gotta be a plothole. Or he just seriously didn't care. After all, most pirates were very selfish, even when they faced exctinction.

piratesofthecaribbean,1gzdm86,On Stranger Tides sucks,lywwthv,2024-11-25 15:00:41,"I think part of the problem, and that gets overlooked, is the few returning members of the cast from At World's End. Outside of Mr. Gibbs, Barbossa and Jack, few if anyone else makes a return and this likely caused the writers for the movie to try and make a plot around who was available. It's not guaranteed that the movie would've been better if other actors and actresses from the previous films were at this movies disposal, but it may have allowed for a more important and natural continuation of the main storyline set after At World's End and giving the franchise a chance to continue with a solid start to a new trilogy.

I remember seeing it in theatres when it first came out and I enjoyed the movie. As a more causal, yet still passionate, fan I didn't mind its flaws much (though that has more to do with how much younger I was) and took what it offered in. At the same time, the film felt so small, minor, in comparison to what happened before. We went right from a grand, epic final battle to decide the fate of the Sea's and piracy to a small, three way race, to the Fountain of Youth with a few minor side quest along the way. 

The first film was like this, in a sense, when it came with the stakes but its case is acceptable as it was the first and did well enough with the adventure and action that you could enjoy it regardless. The second was great as it bumped things up and we were crossing into some unknown waters now with a more dangerous threat on the horizon and the gradual end of piracy. Then the third movie hits us as the fight for survival begins and along the way, the characters confront their own personal struggles on the lead up to the final battle.

The fourth film feels like a immediate downgrade. Like a roller coaster we went from the peek and dived straight down the track to the bottom. This plus some of the gaps in logic and flaws with the characters themselves makes this feel like a shallow quest and nothing more. None of it really mattered in the end anyway, as their was no far reaching consequences. Angelica never came back, the Pearl remained in a bottle till the next one, we don't know what became of Will and Elizabeth till the next one, the Spanish went off and we only really get to see only Salazar's personal quest and nothing more, and only Barbossa as captain of the Revenge came to anything but didn't really effect much.

We took a detour and after crossing through a shabby town, came out the other side no different before moving on.

The movie either could've tried setting up a new arc dealing with the fallout of the War on Piracy and see the rise of a anti pirate alliance lead by the Spanish and British as they seek out and hunt Pirates down. Along the way, Jack searches for the Fountain in order to achieve immortality and to live forever as he and Mr. Gibbs are on the run with Pirate hunters after them. Jack learns that Blackbeard is also after the Fountain and a race begins between the two in order to see who will get there first.

Along the way, Barbossa joins up and soon he and Jack are left to discuss their fate and what their legacy will be even if they succeed, having a similar talk like during in World's End whilst on the island for supplies. Just as they reach their destination they learn Blackbeard has made it first, but before that, so have the English who have done their own investigation into the Fountain and now seek it out to create the eternal ""empire"" where the sun will never set and Britain shall rule the waves for always. 

Still being hunted by pirate hunters under the French and Spanish, Blackbeard and he's crew, alongside Angelica, meet up with Jack and Co and come up with a plan to prevent the British from using the Fountain and its powers. Cue a epic battle around the Fountain as the pirates fight the Redcoats where many fall on either side till finally, the French and Spanish arrive which causes the British to leave in a panic and the Pirates to escape, but not before destroying the Fountain behind them and leaving nothing behind.

The aftermath sees Blackbeard and Angelica leave their own way, whilst Jack, Mr. Gibbs, and Barbossa head off on their own and into the horizon as Jack mentions that the Spanish may come after them now after they managed to destroy several of their men in the battle for the Fountain of Youth.",Impressive_Echidna63
piratesofthecaribbean,1gzdm86,On Stranger Tides sucks,lyxxlk2,2024-11-25 18:13:14,">Okay, this is the literal coldest take that this sub has seen today or probably this year. In Stranger Tides not only sucks at being a Pirates movie but it also as a movie in general.

Honestly... I've seen worse takes. Any hate on P4 and/or P5 is a dime a dozen.

>It feels like everything this movie does never pays off. It introduces all of these new ideas but everything single one feels half-baked and ends before it gets interesting. The zombie pirates—lame; the voodoo doll—lame; weird mermaid love subplot—lame, Jack and Angelica—lame.

Disagreed on Jack/Angelica and Philip/Syrena to an extent. P4 cut out some details about Angelica having learned the rules of the Fountain (Profane Ritual) from Tia Dalma in exchange for a ring, the same ring Jack stole from Tia in P2, which actually exchanged between Jack and Angelica's hands even in the final cut. Of course, bear in mind, this is without considering the fact that 20 years has been added to the timeline.

Philip and Syrena's story was actually suppose to continue for P5, but I admit that is hardly a defense for their roles in P4. Although I am still sore that we were properly introduced to the mermaid ""Syrena"" by name, while we were supposed to know the missionary's name (""Philip"" or even the full name ""Philip Swift"") even 3/4 into the film.

>I actually think this movie would benefit with cutting out a lot of the fluff. The movie should have had a stronger focus on the Spaniards. Having the race between them and Blackbeard to get the fountain of youth would have helped make the story more concise.

I think most can agree that more of the Spanish would have been nice. And it would still fit into the original purpose in having them, so that the film wouldn't be ""pirates chasing pirates"". Granted, we had the British, but they were still led by the pirate (er ""privateer"") Hector Barbossa alongside Joshamee Gibbs.

>I think the most criminal thing this movie does is neglect Barbosa’s story. We spent the past three movies with the Pearl and suddenly it’s gone. Barbosa is missing a leg and I think there should have been a flashback or that is what the movie opens with and that’s how Blackbeard finds out the fountain.

Hmm, not the most criminal thing, methinks. Barbossa's story is arguably the best thing about P4, but that may be depending on who you ask. Blackbeard finding out the Fountain of Youth shouldn't have been through Barbossa, since it was already a well-known legend about how one may avoid death, live forever, etc. In addition to the aforementioned bit about Angelica having learned about the ritual, one more reason about how Blackbeard would know about the Fountain beyond one encounter with Barbossa.

As far as flashback, I'd argue opening scene. Show the Queen Anne's Revenge attacking the Black Pearl, rigging coming to life, Barbossa cutting off his leg, etc, but without showing Blackbeard or the Sword of Triton akin to how we only saw the Pearl without Barbossa or cursed skeleton pirates until later in P1. In the case of P4, having the scene more mysterious (perhaps more horrific) in that we don't know what is happening, except maybe that Barbossa knows about Blackbeard's sword, and make it plenty more clear that Barbossa believed the Pearl was sunk, and had zero knowledge about ships in bottles, which was still kinda clear in the final cut. Then start with the Spanish castaway, King Ferdinand, etc. Shouldn't be any longer than 3-4 minutes, if someone still has issue with the running time - for those that don't know, P4 is the second shortest POTC movie.

>The visuals look really good but I think the characters and story suffer in the hands of cool set pieces. Jack feels incredibly Flanderized and he lacks a moral center the other movies nail. Blackbeard is an intimidating villain for sure but it feels like he and Jack don’t have the same stakes in this—so as a viewer, I am left to not care.

The characterizations of Jack and Blackbeard are subjective. Some are fine with Jack in P4, particularly in comparison to P5, as well as how Blackbeard is portrayed. But one may also not be fine with it.

The visuals and set pieces, I more or less agree with. Some are better than others.

>This movie is the epitome of the phrase “Jack of all trades, master of none.” It does so much that in the end, it does nothing well. I am shocked that people find the following film worse because from my experience, Dead Men Tell No Tales is way closer to the originals in quality than this.

Visually and in tone, yes, I would agree that P5 was much closer to P1-3. However, despite its faults, P4 kept to the original continuity, among other differences, as well as being more original by comparison.",CJS-JFan

Like they're goal is to save the Pearl from the depths of Balckbeard's hands whilst Blackbeard himself is looking for the fountain. You have nonsense with Jack and Barbossa stepping on each other toes akin to Worlds End have a few ship battles here and there with QAR only for it to come to a cataclysmic end when they crash upon the Fountain. Duke it out over killing Blackbeard (which can use him as the crux for why the ships are bottled. Like killing him frees them, or who ever owns the sword, kinda like the Dutchmans nonsense) and then the films ends kinda the same.

piratesofthecaribbean,1gzdm86,On Stranger Tides sucks,lyy46fn,2024-11-25 18:47:15,">I think part of the problem, and that gets overlooked, is the few returning members of the cast from At World's End. Outside of Mr. Gibbs, Barbossa and Jack, few if anyone else makes a return and this likely caused the writers for the movie to try and make a plot around who was available. It's not guaranteed that the movie would've been better if other actors and actresses from the previous films were at this movies disposal, but it may have allowed for a more important and natural continuation of the main storyline set after At World's End and giving the franchise a chance to continue with a solid start to a new trilogy.  
  
At the same time, the film felt so small, minor, in comparison to what happened before. We went right from a grand, epic final battle to decide the fate of the Sea's and piracy to a small, three way race, to the Fountain of Youth with a few minor side quest along the way.

Yeah, this is the problem most franchises face: where to go after going big. Where to go after the big battle against the big Death Star...build another Death Star. On the subject of new arcs dealing with the fallout of previous films, that is likely due to the criticisms made about how the POTC sequels were too complex, hard to follow, etc, some of which is warranted, but still, there are fans who do follow the content to the letter.

Of course this is more or less in comparison to the MCU and Star Wars, which could take place thousands of years and with seemingly limitless stories to tell, in comparison to the Golden Age of Piracy, which is only hundreds...and the fact that, POTC notwithstanding, pirate films aren't particularly successful. Adding the fact that Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley declined involvement after finishing the trilogy, which forced the new direction. Ignoring the fact that Bloom ""expressed interest"" in October 2011, right after P4 made $1 billion. At any rate, despite fan reactions, P4-5 did deliver on how Gore Verbinski once commented about POTC post-trilogy: ""I would start fresh and focus on the further adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow."" Obviously, the fact that P4-5 were ""purely financial"" came in more recent years, but the same could be said about P2-3, among other examples.

>None of it really mattered in the end anyway, as their was no far reaching consequences. Angelica never came back, the Pearl remained in a bottle till the next one, we don't know what became of Will and Elizabeth till the next one, the Spanish went off and we only really get to see only Salazar's personal quest and nothing more, and only Barbossa as captain of the Revenge came to anything but didn't really effect much.

Angelica being left out of P5 still baffles me. She isn't in Terry Rossio's version, Jeff Nathanson's version, or even in the final cut version, despite having cast Javer Bardem (Penelope Cruz's husband) in the film. I can only assume it is because not enough love was given to the character on and off screen.

But still, P4, and indeed P5, were meant to be more standalone in comparison to the trilogy, which even then P1 could stand on its own without the need of a P2-3. But with that said, Terry Rossio's version of P5 felt more like a continuation of P4 by comparison, but of course that version wasn't greenlit. But still, some story points can be argued for or against, depending on the point in question. Leaving the Black Pearl in a bottle at the end of P4 wasn't ideal, but clearly meant to be left as a set-up for a sequel.

With all that being said, yes, there could have been better development on the overall storyline. Even more than the simple issue of ""no ship battles"" which is understandable, but there are bigger issues to be had.",CJS-JFan

[You can thank Tim Powers for that one.](https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/On_Stranger_Tides_(novel))

Although it can be agreed Blackbeard's (voodoo) magic could have been used beyond the scenes with the Jack voodoo doll. Perhaps have the magic be the method in which the ships in bottles were made, as P4 never clearly showed how either was done: sword controls ships, Blackbeard makes voodoo dolls. Of course, by P5, it was defined that magic sword = ships in bottle, which to me felt a bit unoriginal by comparison. Partly as that was not the original intentions of the ideas.

Not really, since their story had ended. Whether or not we're talking P3 and/or P5, they end almost the exact same way with the Turner family reunited, albeit without the ambiguity. Take away the question on whether or not Will was freed after the P3 ""Ten years later"" post-credit, they still were together at the end.

Also consider the fact that neither Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightley wanted to return. At least until Bloom made his comments at the earliest in October 2011, after P4 made $1 billion...and when he was struggling in his career before returning for both POTC and The Hobbit...just throwing that out. Other than her non-speaking cameo in P5, Knightley has pretty much kept her stance that she was done: ""I mean, she sailed away so nicely. She sailed away in brilliant style, but if she could be able to then yea she might return for the final adventure."" Could, yes, but also could not.",CJS-JFan

It’s still the second worst pirates film, but it’s just a fun little self contained Jack Sparrow story. Fun filler. Which should have been followed up with substantially better film. 

Jack is still Captain Jack Sparrow. Not a goofy drunk side character.

Blackbeard is bland but still interesting enough for me. Acting is solid and his introduction sold me.

I LIKED Angelica. I always have and I always will. A fine foil for Jack.

Barbossa is at his funniest, is developed, has a solid motivation, and his chemistry with Jack is *chef’s kiss*

Spanish were funny third parties.

Music was still peak. 

The mermaid scene was awesome.

DMTNT is an affront to this series. A hollywood executives poisonous vision for the future of filmmaking.

Edit: I just realized what would have made this movie exponentially better. Jack’s washed up and things aren’t working out for him, so instead of becoming a genuine fucking moron he just drops the idiot facade entirely and for most of the movie we’re faced with the “real” Jack Sparrow.

1. Jack: Still has most of his wits about him in OST (though considerably less so than in the Trilogy), but DMTNT really takes the cake in the deterioration of Jacks character progression. He seems like a disoriented drunkard just stumbling and mumbling along.
2. Plotholes and Retcon: Everything about the Trident of Poseidon and the background of Jacks compass - DMTNT retcons already established Lore to both, or in the case of the trident, creates a huge plothole as to why it was never mentioned or used in the previous films. The trident is not even specifically related to Salazars curse (as was the heart of Jones or the Aztec medaillons), but is a universal way to get rid of all curses - to me that seems very uncreative and quite frankly lazy in comparison. And as for the Compass, we all remember the trilogy mentioned Tia Dalma had given it to Jack, which was retconned by DMTNT.
3. Nostalgia bait: DMTNT tries (or tried) to garner attention by having the Turners - Will and Elizabeth - return to the franchise, but this was pure Nostalgia bait. Elizabeth did not speak at all and appeared in very few scenes; Will had barely any more screentime, and none of those two contribute to most of the movie anyway.
4. Same old recipe: DMTNT uses the same formula for its movie as did the movies of the trilogy: Undead Crew being a menace and threat to all people including Jack, our heroes have to get a magic item to make them mortal again (or get rid of them by breaking the curse). It was the case for Barbossas crew and the aztec medaillon, Davy Jones and his Chest/Heart, now its the same for Undead Salazar and the Trident. You can only use the same recipe so often before it gets boring - and I reached that point with DMTNT. Plotwise, OST at least tried to do something new.
5. The Spanish: Throughout four of the five movies, we only see ONE colonial power present in the Caribbean - the British. They are there in movies 1, 2, 3 and 5. Its only in OST that the Spanish take any real part in the story - strictly speaking they are indirectly present in DMTNT as well as Salazar was a Spanish Captain, but for most of the movie he only exists as an Undead thirsting for revenge. Which is quite a shame given that the Spanish, French and Dutch also had a notable colonial presence in the Caribbean.",Vir-victus

From what I can tell, perhaps not the exact reasons:

1. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were involved with the screenplay.
2. Little-to-no (I'd argue no) continuity issues.
3. Characters were still true to form. Like Jack, while not trilogy quality, still felt like Jack.
4. Overall feeling more original, with mermaids being unique compared to another undead crew.

While they is no defense against Blackbeard vs Salazar, Henry/Carina vs Philip/Syrena, and of course the musical score, neither of which were better than the other, though everyone has their tastes. Regarding the music, though, while P4-5 both reused a lot, I'd argue P4 reused less than P5, with the only thing P5 has for it being the ""wow"" factor on how they used reused music. There is also the little-known fact about Hans wanting to have done more for P4 but was shut down by some executives.

Barbossa not being himself in P4 was the point. After Blackbeard's attack on the Black Pearl (which he believed to be sunk) he was without a ship, and being crippled had few options, his standing among other pirates would be lowered. His best best for revenge was to approach the British and offer his services as privateer. If one didn't like that Barbossa was a British official, that would be one thing, but the way Barbossa acquired a new ship, crew, and a mystical weapon used to control ships (not necessarily how Blackbeard created the ships in bottles, just to say) is hardly out of character.

P5, meanwhile, retcons or at least contradicts the previous films. It may be a small issue, due to some being mentioned, implied, or covered in expanded universe media, but it is enough to make the more diehard fans upset. And if we're talking about who was not in character, Jack aside, how about Joshamee Gibbs abandoning Jack...like sure, he may get tired of Jack's crap, but he is supposed to be ""the one character who's continuously loyal to Jack Sparrow. Gibbs is the one shining beacon of hope for humanity."" Will being bound to the Dutchman rather than being freed after the first ten years, fine, I'll let you have that one.

I can never understand this. I mean, I understand the criticism of the reusing old soundtrack music, sure, as it is one of my criticisms of P4-5. But I don't understand how P5 had better music than P4, when really they both had a pretty much recycled soundtrack. Comparing the two, P4 felt more original in that the film had a few more newer themes (Blackbeard, the Spanish, and Mermaids) than P5, which basically only had the one theme for Salazar, which was basically a revised version of Blackbeard's theme.

Really the only thing P5 has going for it is the ""wow"" factor in how they used reused music.",CJS-JFan

Prepare for an essay lmao

For me, 4’s score feels more derivative of the originals than 5. Blackbeard’s theme is just a reworking of the “dirty biker gang” sound for Jones and his crew from 2 and 3. Also, using the “Swords Crossed” material for the mutiny was extraordinarily lazy, using the music from Beckett’s death at the lighthouse makes zero sense (and sullies the dramatic effect of the original scene) and almost all of “Palm Tree Escape” is pulled almost note-for-note from material from the first and second scores. It also doesn’t help that the best parts of the 4th score are all from someone other than Zimmer. The guitar stuff for Angelica? Rodrigo y Gabriela. The gorgeously intoxicating mermaid theme? Eric Whitacre. The album is also produced and mixed pretty bad, with music out of chronological order, a horrendously compressed mix that recalls the first score (and that first score sounds like that because it was done in 2 weeks), and a shitload of remixes that don’t belong on the score album. 

As for the fifth score, the new motifs not only fit into the franchise sound, but were also distinctly new and exciting (Salazar’s theme, Carina’s theme and the new heroic Jack theme all come to mind, and the latter shares runtime with the original “He’s A Pirate” and “Jack Sparrow” theme). The use of old music makes sense where they tracked it almost all the time (I do concede that tracking in “Hoist the Colors” for the Dying Gull was a bit odd though). In particular, hearing “The Medallion Calls” roar to life as the Pearl came back was thrilling, hearing Beckett’s death as Barbossa died made sense (tying the music to the dramatic death of a prominent character) and the use of the old love themes for Will and Liz’s reunion at the end was very well done and well earned. The end credits starting with the franchise theme before moving to the new Carina theme was an inspired touch.

The Spanish Theme, to me, is forgettable and not used enough.  As I was typing my original comment, I actually forgot about the Spanish theme. Blackbeards theme is really the only big, new theme but it isn’t reusable. I guess I was looking for a new, non character specific theme. A situational theme. And I just find myself humming the new adventure theme a lot as well as the main theme for DNTNT. Overall, I still feel Geoff balanced new stuff with old stuff well. That’s what I look for in a new POTC score. 

Now don’t get me wrong, people assume that when others say one thing is better than the other the thing that is less good is bad. That is not the case. I love the score to four.

But yeah, it is a debatable issue. I think it can be mostly agreed that the musical score P4-5 are both unoriginal compared to P1-3, though if one score had to be picked is a matter of who you ask.

I agree about most of the reusages, but although I still enjoyed some, with ""Swords Crossed"" being used during Jack's mutiny being a guilty pleasure of mine. Themes from P2-3 being used duing Blackbeard's theme and later at the Whitecap Bay lighthouse were odd but I was fine with them, but I can totally see where one finds it an issue. The only one I probably can't get over was the cue used in the London carriage chase, ""Davy Jones in London"" as I would call it, also used during the Fountain of Youth battle, which also made little sense but that one I was fine with. I've also never been a fan of the remixes featured in any of the soundtrack albums.

(I may as well follow the mermaids and undead crew bit here. Mermaids being cool is generally accepted, as far as I know. The zombies being ""another undead crew"" can be agreed on, but some argue that they weren't really zombies beyond name and one instance of surviving a sword stab. But that is the problem, I admit, of a director removing a zombiefied cook from the film due to it being ""too scary for a Disney film""...ironic as that may be. While I like the zombies, they aren't exactly the undead crew compared to Barbossa's, Jones', or indeed Salazar's)

As I said, P5 did better, if I may say ""wow"" factor again, in mixing old and (what little of) new to the score to be exciting. Or as you said, most of where where they used the old music made sense, though there are examples in which they didn't, though that depends on who you ask...with Hoist the Colours being the most odd usage indeed. For me, I like ""Medallion Calls"" but hearing it more than once was jarring - as I wrote to another, if only used once, I would have saved it for the ending scene with Jack sailing on the Pearl. And while I like ""One Day"" as a journey/love theme for the Turners, I wished the old P1-2 love theme were used for Will and Elizabeth, but granted maybe they grew out of that one. I may also concede about Carina's theme, with what little we actually hear of it in the film. But again, Salazar's theme sounds more like a remixed version of Blackbeard's (or perhaps others), and the ""new heroic theme"" I'm presuming is 2:52 of what is played in No Woman Has Ever Handled My Herschel, which I'm sorry to say may be new to the films but not new to the franchise overall, having first appeared in a video game (P3's I think)...I admit, it is a silly way to say that I've heard this theme (or a variation of it) before 2017, but I can attest this to be true.

With all that said, again, everyone has their personal tastes. I'm glad P5 was a cup of tea you and most fans enjoy - and even the ones who don't like the film, criticize it, etc, still say they like it. Sad to say, it isn't mine.",CJS-JFan

There is a bunch of Rodrigo y Gabriela tracks, like ""The Pirate That Should Not Be"" which were mostly soundtrack exclusive than in the actual film, so that may or may not be counted.

I know where you're coming from with P5, and I can see why fans may like that soundtrack more by comparison. By itself, it isn't bad listening to, but if I were to have a marathon of the five films, I'd have trouble sitting through this last one (or two if I were to count P4), with the soundtrack being one issue.

It interchanges with Hans’s “On Stranger Tides theme” actually so I don’t think the mermaids themselves have a theme since this seems to be Hans’s “all encompassing theme”.  To be fair, the soundtrack might do his score injustice. Perhaps I shall compare the full OST score to the full DMTNT score. Regardless, DMTNT gave me a new, reusable theme, if you know what I mean lol. 

Like, for example, DMC gave us that….idk what to call it…that theme that first appeared when they were rolling the bone cages and they lost footing and rolled down and hill and up a tree. It’s the B section of the Jack Sparrow track on that soundtrack. 

At Worlds End gave us the Up is Down theme and the general At Worlds Theme. 

DMTNT gave us that new adventure theme that I love and could see being used in a 6th film.

Supposedly, Hans took a larger part in composing Klaus' score for P1, having said he let Klaus have the credit in some interview somewhere. But then, who knows what happened in the room. Speaking of which, as with all P4 score-related posts, I am compelled to share that Zimmer actually expressed his displeasure of the eventual soundtrack. Unfortunately the website this was posted (Virtual Composers forum) doesn't exist anymore, but I do have this one post I can confirm is legit:

>*I am truly sorry that anyone watched POTC ""On Stranger Tides"".I wish Thomas would comment as eloquently... on our shared suffering on that one. Honestly, we really had a good idea, but alas...It's very hard to tell a company they can't use the temp when they actually own it! Now, that's Temp Hell...But Mickey Mousing is, of course, appropriate for a Disney picture.*

But yeah, regardless on if one likes P4 or P5 more score-wise, I think most would agree that the music was at its peak in the original Pirates trilogy. Though I guess that is the case with most franchises, like Star Wars - looking at you, Sequel Trilogy, which of course I put the blame towards the filmmakers and executives over the legendary John Williams.",CJS-JFan

And yes, Hans was definitely behind the scenes for P1. He even admitted he composed the theme used when Elizabeth discovers Barbossa and his crew are cursed skele-men. 

The adventure theme I’m referring to makes its first appearance in No Woman Has Ever Handled My Herschel at around 2:52. It appears a few more times throughout the score. 

One praise and critique I have of Geoff’s score is that it brought back the, what I call the Jack Sparrow entrance theme. The theme that plays whenever Jack is introduced in the first three films. I missed it in OST. However, Geoff used that theme like three times in the score and I think that was too many. I like it as a one and done type theme.

Ohhh, *that* adventure theme...har har.

It may be new to the (five thus far) film franchise, but what if I told you this theme did exist before P5? I can't remember for the life of me where exactly it was, but while it may not sound exactly the same, the theme actually sounds similar to one I heard through one of the video games - I want to say the P3 video game, but I wouldn't rule out LEGO game either. There is always the chance I'm misremembering things, but I'm 92% sure it's not the case here due to having played more than a few times way back when.

In a way, I did like hearing it, but not in retrospect in having heard it before. Which doesn't take away from one's enjoyment in listening to it as a music piece, of course. Just in one's viewing of the scene (or the film in general) in question.

>One praise and critique I have of Geoff’s score is that it brought back the, what I call the Jack Sparrow entrance theme. The theme that plays whenever Jack is introduced in the first three films.

Oh yeah, this is an issue one can't ignore. I like the Justice Smith trial scene, albeit terrible direction in cinematography and/or editing, but the theme was indeed missed. I'm sure it could have been played somewhere in the final version, albeit with better editing, like maybe when Jack is dragged into St. James's Palace - save the British drums for after.

That said, while it did good for my ears to hear the theme again, I didn't really like where it was played, but that may be (in part) due to my partial distaste for the scene where the bottled Black Pearl was restored, despite the scene being cool, though that is another matter entirely . It is indeed a better theme when it is one and done, and if I had to choose where in the final version of the film as is, I'd say the final scene with the Pearl sailing in Jack's ""rendezvous beyond \[his\] beloved horizon."" Seems appropriate.

It wouldn’t be the exact version but a variation. But I think Up is Down was a good choice for the scene. I’ve racked my brain about where that theme could go in that movie and I can’t think of a good place. The scene is supposed to be what plays in Jacks head so being hauled away may not work. He isn’t t feeling very triumphant. Which is why I chose the end. He one upped Angelica and is now sailing away. My thought is, as Jack is rowing away, Up is Down could play for a moment until Angelica fires her gun. Musical pause. You missed.  Then a brief version of Jack’s intro theme could play as he rows away and we get that overhead shot. Then again those two themes could be jarring next to each other but I think the idea works.

But who knows if a combo would work. While I agree the theme should be played at a moment where Jack feels triumphant, Jack being dragged would be about the same as rowing away on a coffin, or at least that was my thought on it. I'm sure most of the film's scenes/soundtracks could have been worked on better than it did.

>As far as the adventure theme goes for DMTNT, it’s definitely not in the other scores. I’ve listened to each one hundreds of times haha.

LOL I know. I said I heard the adventure theme in one of the video games. I admit, it is a silly way to say that I've heard this theme (or a variation of it) before 2017, but I can attest this to be true.

Granted, I am no expert by any means as far as behind-the-scenes (who among us are?) but the developers of the video game(s) get as much as they can out of the film productions, which I suspect includes music that may or may not be used in the film(s), including the cue that we would later hear in P5's ""No Woman Has Ever Handled My Herschel"". Now, this would imply that this music cue has been in an archive somewhere for almost a decade after being used for a game, but stranger things have been known to happen.

>Beyond the Horizon is a good scene to have that theme as well. Right before the credits. Didn’t P1 do that?

I mean, if we are under the presumption the Jack theme can only be used once, what better scene is there to leave it? Especially since they already used it anyway. And no, P1 didn't do that...per say. Thinking on top of my head (could be mistaken) P1 played a slower version of the theme prior to the credits, unsure if it is the same or a different theme by technicality, but it is certainly not the triumphant theme we're speaking of.",CJS-JFan

I guess we can blame one's lack of sleep for that blunder as well. Lol

But yeah, it is a debatable issue as far as where and how the theme should be used. One would say it could have been easier to A) Go back in time to tell the Mouse executives to back off and let Zimmer do his thing, or B) Go further back in time and have a (slightly) different movie made. Personally, I'd leave the story as is but have a better director - nothing against Rob Marshall, as I think he did better story-wise in P4 than what Joachim Ronning/Espen Sandberg in P5, but there is the matter of cinematography, editing, score, etc, which is equally as important and I guess why Ronning/Sandberg's film gets praise.",CJS-JFan

So the option would be to have a slightly different movie. 

Speaking of different movie, I love the movie up until they actually get on the island or wherever they were, I forgot. Then there is a lot of walking around and dialogue and not a lot of conflict. 

Maybe a bit more back and forth with the chalices, some sword fight, maybe a bit more Indiana Jones-esque puzzles. Idk. All I know is that the latter portion of the film needed a bit more substance.",CommonSteak2437

Although, I personally like the movie as is, but agree it could have had a little more...pizzazz, if you will. Sadly, it is one that only dreams (or YouTube fan edits) can change.

Some argue that a ship battle should have happened, I'd argue the voyage(s) as depicted in the film was fine as is, but I would add a prologue scene at the beginning akin to the P1 opening where they time jump years later - except in this case, open with the attack on Barbossa's crew, only showing the rigging coming to life (maybe the Queen Anne's Revenge) rather than revealing Blackbeard in full before the mutiny, and cut off either at the exact moment when Barbossa decides to cut off his leg (ironic) OR in some establishing shot where they make it clear Barbossa believes the Pearl to be sunk, which is true in the context of at least P4 and Rossio's version of P5, while debatable in P5 final version. But I digress.

Getting back to your idea(s) about the island - which is correct, as it is not Florida or any other location yet to be named at this time, if at all. I mean, being a jungle trek similar in nature (no pun intended) to the Hobbit/LOTR series, walking around and maybe dialogue is inevitable. I think cinematography (or direction in Marshall's case) could have been done better than it was, as I see walking around/dialogue done better in other movies. Swordfight-wise, I think the film had enough, though I feel we should have had the battle at the Fountain (i.e. Barbossa vs Blackbeard) be done better where it didn't look like it was stunt doubles the whole time...granted, it may have been in the case in the other films, but one could believe that Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were fighting each other, and not to point out the Davy Jones fight since Jones was CGI the whole time.

Flashback or prologue? That has been my idea of how P4 could have been improved, begin with the attack on the Black Pearl then time jump to the Ancient Sailor/Spanish Castaway and King Ferdinand scene, similar to how P1 began with young Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner then time jumped eight years later, albeit without the ""I had a dream"" scenario. Show the Queen Anne's Revenge's attack on the Pearl, show how Barbossa lost his leg as well as his belief the Pearl had been sunk, etc without showing Blackbeard, the Sword of Triton's power to control wind/ships, or even the magics behind the Pearl turning into a ship in a bottle. Similar to how P1 introduced the Black Pearl and the Aztec Gold within the first 5-10 minutes without showing Barbossa or the skeletal pirates until later into the movie.",CJS-JFan

Not to say that wasn't something Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio wanted, given Rossio's comment that it wasn't their decision to make a standalone sequel, but they did have to work with what they got. At that point in time, Will and Elizabeth's storyline did end in a way where they could have just ended things there...have Will be free after the ""Ten Years Later"" post-credit rather than him serving for over 20 years aboard the Dutchman. Also consider that Keira Knightley, and even Orlando Bloom way back when (you know, until he realized he made more money with POTC and Middle-Earth films), declined further involvement in the series, hence the story we got.

I'm not sorry with this mindset, because P5 showed that just because Will and Elizabeth are in the film does not equal success, same with P4 not having Will and Elizabeth. It depends on the handling of the story, as well as directing, which is apparently hard to top how Gore Verbinski handled the trilogy.",CJS-JFan

Hmm, maybe. There are some problems with that, if we're going by the final version of P4, including the matter of the ships in bottles. On top of working around the plotpoints regarding the Profane Ritual of the Fountain where at least one character (i.e. Blackbeard) dies, you would have to get everyone from the 1-2 day jungle trek to the Fountain of Youth and back to the ships at sea (a minor issue, given timeframe of Angelica's marooning and Barbossa taking over the Revenge), and of course release the Pearl through whatever magical method (according to Rossio's version of events, i.e. P5, not Blackbeard's sword, which is actually meant to be associated with the Trident mythology) in a way that makes sense within the story intended to be told. As far as the mermaids, it would be hard to get more than just Syrena involved, given she is the less lethal-minded. In other words, there would have to be some change in storylines, or at least the handling of what the film's budget is paying for.

Personally I'm fine with the version of P4 we got, with the final battle being at the Fountain, as it was similar in some respects to the final battle at Isla de Muerta in P1. Yes, the story ends with Jack and Gibbs retrieving the Pearl, even though it was still in its bottled state, with the presumption that we were going to have another film (i.e. P5) in which the Pearl is released that was good. Our beloved Pearl is out of the bottle, but I wish we had a better film out of it.

Of course, with all that said, it is a matter of one's opinion how things should be.",CJS-JFan

(Which is repaired by barbossa and his crew after blackbeards death)

Maybe the sequence of events could be:

- the mutiny scene happens and Jack is forced to follow blackbeard (like the normal plot)

-they capture syrena (like the normal plot)

- they trek through the jungle to find the place where they extract the mermaids tear

-they find the x marks the spot, but are unable to find an entrance to the fountain as all the entrances are blocked by vines and trees to thick to cut

-they split up, with one group going back to the revenge (so they can use the flamethrowers to open the entrance) and the other to claim the chalices from the shipwreck (while Jack escapes)

- Jack meets barbossa and the plot continues normally through the tilting ship scene and finding out the Spanish found the chalices already, but blackbeard's zombies arrive and a fight ensues, ending in the ship plummeting and the zombies falling to their death but Jack and barbossa escaping

- on the revenge, priest guy covertly snatches the black Pearl's bottle while the others prepare the ship, while blackbeard receives the news that the Spanish have the chalices

- Jack and barbossa are captured by the Spanish and the coconut fight happens as normal, and they claim the chalices

- blackbeard takes barbossa's crew and Jack hostage

- priest guy finds syrena and releases her into the water 

- the queen Anne's revenge burns an entrance into the fountain, but Jack takes the bottled pearl and escapes on a row boat

- Jack smashes the bottle open, making the pearl grow again, and (with much difficulty as it needs 6 people to crew) drives it near the revenge. 

- blackbeard tries to use the sword of triton to control the pearl, but syrena calls the other mermaids who start attacking blackbeards crew and tearing chunks off the revenge, forcing blackbeard to fight back with the ship instead

- in the chaos, barbossa's remaining crew sneak onto the pearl while avoiding snakelike ropes and flying shrapnel

- blackbeard takes the chalices and tries to escape to the fountain 

-Jack, angelica and barbossa follow while a fierce naval battle ensues

- barbossa and blackbeard begin fighting while Jack and angelica struggle to get the chalices and the bottled tear

-the Spanish arrive, and the Spanish captain takes the chalices and gives his speech, and crushes them as normal. Spanish cannons start blasting the fountain apart

- scrum, seeing blackbeard winning, goes into the underbelly of the ship and fires the flamethrowers, causing blackbeard to dive out of the way of the incoming fire and get impaled on barbossa's sword.

- the Spanish leave, the mermaids leave the now-damaged revenge alone after eating most of the crew, barbossa goes back to the pearl, and the final scene continues as normal.

*If I may be so bold as to interject my professional opinion*, there was at least one ""official"" source in terms of the ""X"" on Jack's cheek, but it's still mostly a mystery. According to what was revealed in the Disney Second Screen feature for OST:

>*In the time since ol' Jack faced down Lord Beckett and battled Davy Jones,* ***he acquired an ""X"" on his right cheek. Jack will not divulge from whence it came, nor how, but rumor has it that it is a mark of bond he shares with a blood brother whose identity is yet unknown to all but that man and Captain Jack himself.*** *Any mention of it is known to send Jack into the foulest of moods, and he is even given to breaking a looking glass to avoid reminder of this particular aspect of his visage. Dread bad luck. But worst luck still awaits the man who pesters Jack for an explanation of that mark.*  
>  
>\[Note: this does NOT mean that Jack has a real brother\]

I'm 92% sure the italicized section is verbatim to what was revealed. And regardless on whether it is or isn't, it's very likely this will remain a mysterious ""What happened?"" tale. Especially since Disney put little care in keeping some continuity more iron-clad.",CJS-JFan

Clearly Gore Verbinski is the brain of the whole franchise. Aside from the visual and action scenes, the man himself can play some music and he's a good friend with Hans Zimmer. So in the 4th, Hans has to do the music alone without Gore. I think that's the reason the soundtrack is lackluster.

piratesofthecaribbean,1h3vsni,"Just rewatched On Stranger Tides after years, it's still a super mixed bag for me ",lzup8b8,2024-12-01 10:21:47,">Moving away from epic, giant stakes of At World's End was the right call since this is supposed to be a smaller scale epilogue of the trilogy. There's no way you're topping that movie anyway. Less supernatural elements is also nice, glad they tried something new and NOT have another undead villain crew.

While most didn't like the idea of a standalone sequel, I felt it was appropriate to scale back, as you point out. There were still some elements of the supernatural with Blackbeard's Sword of Triton used to control ships and the zombie crew, but yes, it was not in the way that we saw before with skeletal Barbossa and fishfaced Davy Jones.

>A pretty mid plot overall. The idea of a treasure hunt for the fountain of youth with these groups of people racing to it is good on paper, but I just never find the execution to be engaging.

As one reviewer said, P4 was stellar on paper, with the direction being the issue. Or, as you say, the execution being less engaging. The quest for the Fountain of Youth should have been as magnificent as you would see in the Middle-Earth series, Narnia, and more, but for me it didn't fully deliver on that.

>BUT, I think he could've lead this movie alone just fine, the problem was his character still wasn't the driving force of the storyline and he isn't given any more development to make him more layered as a person. He isn't made to be the arch nemisis of the main villain, Barbossa is. Jack doesn't even have a sword fight with Blackbeard, why?

I have also argued before that making Captain Jack Sparrow the main character wasn't a bad move, as that is the direction taken in the POTC franchise, even with P2-3. Rather it depends on how the film is written, directed, etc, though I'm sure the fact we had 2 films with mid-success, but even then, they did follow Verbinski's original wishes for a post-trilogy film to focus on the further adventures.

Jack not having a swordfight with Blackbeard, I admit, was a tad disappointing, given that he fought every other villain in the movie franchise thus far, Barbossa, Jones, and Salazar. But methinks that giving Barbossa the honor of fighting the pirate all pirates fear wasn't a bad move either, as he said, ""For the Pearl.""

>The weakest soundtrack in the franchise by far. It's mostly just all recycled work from the trilogy. 

It's more or less a mixed subject. P4's soundtrack is mostly reused, but P5's is worse by comparison.

>Getting rid of the Black Pearl. Why? What good did that do?

They didn't get rid of the Black Pearl. Only magicked into a ship in a bottle.

Production-wise, I think they were trying to make P4 as different a film as they could, without making it an overt continuation of the trilogy. And partly because of the Queen Anne's Revenge being the main focus as far as pirate ships in the film. Or maybe they were intended for Barbossa's motivation in the film to be seeking revenge on Blackbeard for the (in his point of view) sinking of the Pearl.

>The Queen Anne's Revenge, amazing design, but no ship battle? Why? Missed opportunity there.

I think most agree there. I've considered that P4 is (mostly) fine as is story-wise, but have a ship battle take place as the very beginning of the film, mainly showing the events in which Barbossa lost his leg and the Pearl without revealing too much, before showing the Spanish castaway and King Ferdinand scene.

Of course, I'm fine with the mutiny on Blackbeard's ship.

>The humor is weak. Maybe not as bad as 5, but it's still pretty bland. While comedy isn't a huge focus on this franchise, the original trilogy was hilarious when it wanted to be. And was placed at appropriate times.

>Verbinski's direction is CLEARLY absent here. His stunning visuals are now gone as is his quirky style and atmosphere he brilliantly builds in all his movies. And while I said the action sequences here were fine, there's nothing that compares to Verbinski's enthralling excitment he brings to any blockbuster he directs.

Agreed. I admit that P4 lacked the ""laugh out loud"" moments, but I do think that the humor was a bit more original in comparison to P5, which felt too modern for my tastes. Same with the action, though I do still lean towards P4 than P5. My guess is that, as most may agree, different directors isn't always a good thing.

>Why did Jack maroon Angelica on the island? Goes against all the lore of Jack seeking revenge on Barbossa in the first film for doing the same to him.

This is complicated, though not entirely against the lore. Jack's revenge on Barbossa was that he violated the Code, and stole his beloved Pearl.

Angelica shanghaied Captain Jack into service as a deckhand, got played around through the voodoo doll and other manipulations, etc. throughout the quest for the Fountain of Youth. The only reason Jack felt he needed to save Angelica at the Fountain was that he owed her. ""You stole years of my life, Jack. You owe me."" And of course Blackbeard being a bad man wanting to sacrifice her for his own life. After that, they became mostly square, but of course neither can forgive the other; Angelica clearly wants revenge on Jack for her father's death, and Jack wants revenge for being dragged into Blackbeard's quest, hence the marooning.",CJS-JFan

The marooning part makes no sense, but also not in a practical way. What ship is Jack using? Did he row from the fountain to this island and then rows further to where Gibbs is? How did Gibbs get there? People seem to be able to teleport, how did Gibbs and Jack end up in England? I also have the feeling that England as a location isn't really important for anything.  
Gibbs is sentenced as Jack Sparrow while a real Jack Sparrow impersonator goes unnoticed? Why did anyone think that he was Jack?  
It's never really explained, what they want with the fountain, is it? Angelica wants to give years from her own life to Blackbeard but why? To save his soul somehow? Would she die in the process like Blackbeard dies in the end? Don't they say that one person gives their potential remaining life to the other but Angelica AND Blackbeard are both poisoned and dying at the moment. And the map really wasn't that detailed to show anything more than the location of the island.   
  
This is really a weak plot. The Spanish were so excited that they found the location of the ship and then they sail there just to destroy the fountain? Do mermaids only live where the fountain is and do they have a connection?

What exactly is Blackbeard's power? The crew is ""zombified"" but no other mention of this, he can do something with voodoo dolls and he can control the ship by himself (so why does he need such a big crew?)",OtherwiseAct8126

 I love On Stranger Tides! Just because it departs  from the trilogy, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I think the characters are a lot more varied and interesting than the trilogy ( especially like the introduction of the Spanish). And I believe Captain Jack is at his best. Really enjoy the frenemy relationship between Captain Jack and Barbosa in this one.  Personally, I was also sick of Elizabeth Swan (she is ok in the 1st, but after that loses all credibility as a character). I am SO glad she is not in this movie.

Blackbeard was kinda cool. I actually really liked how Phillip was written and his romance with Syrena. And it was kinda funny but in a good way that the conclusion of the hunt for the fountain was the Spanish just destroying it in the name of God. But the movie as a whole was just…bland.

piratesofthecaribbean,1dm7stq,"I know On Stranger Tides gets lots of flack, but I think it works better as an extended epilogue to the trilogy.",l9v08ay,2024-06-23 04:27:54,"I don't know about an extended epilogue to the trilogy, but I always liked the idea of the franchise continuing on with the further adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow. With Barbossa and Gibbs, at least, along for the ride, though having the other crewmembers of the Black Pearl were certainly preferable. I liked the new P4 crew more than most fans, but I'd be lying if I said that Pintel and Ragetti were sorely missed.

Whether or not the POTC series ended with P4 has been a debate before P5 actually began production. Personally, it would be difficult to end things with the Black Pearl in a bottle. Jack having his beloved Pearl is a bright side, but compared to being aboard the ship in its full size, which is something even the more critical fans may give P5, despite being arguably the worst film in the series.

Regarding the note about Barbossa, I'm surprised with reading any critique on his character in P4, which is arguably one of the more positive points of an otherwise divisive film. It could be the privateer of the British aspect, or perhaps the execution of the revenge storyline, which I can only blame the fact that it wasn't fully developed so much onscreen versus the development (and some comments) made behind-the-scenes. Overall, I don't think many fans would say that the storyline in question was entirely out of character for Barbossa; he lost his leg, lost his ship which he believes was sunk, and he was hell-bent on revenge on the one responsible, taking his ship and sword with special properties. Unless I'm misinterpreting your meaning there.

>Barbossa gets to end as a Privateer and help take down a sworn enemy, which feels like a full circle moment for him given how he was the main villain in the first film.

Funny you say that, as Barbossa becoming a villain again was one theory of his role post-P4, [which I believe came straight from Geoffrey Rush himself](https://jimhillmedia.com/geoffrey-rush-isnt-rushing-to-exit-disneys-pirates-of-the-caribbean-film-franchise/). Of course, even going by Terry Rossio's screenplay for P5, Barbossa was going to be more of an anti-hero with a bigger threat looming. Although, unlike the more heroic role in the final theatrical version of P5, Barbossa does have a more antagonistic role by the ending of Rossio's draft, albeit with an interesting twist. I'm avoiding specific details, presuming you're unfamiliar with this version.

But yeah, the point of P4, and indeed P5, was to make standalone stories. It worked for most fans, but not so much for others, and some criticism for some fair reasons. Depending on who you ask. Personally, yes, between the two films I am more partial to P4 as it does little-to-no ""screwing with canon"" as you said.",CJS-JFan

DMTNT brings the Black Pearl back and frees Will from his curse and allows him and Elizabeth to reunite.

Presuming, according to the recent so-called ""reboot"" news and these storylines do not continue...

1. Will was supposed to be free in the P3 post-credit scene. For some reason, Liz's love wasn't powerful enough OR more likely Will decided to stay aboard...for whatever reason. Thank P5 filmmakers, kids.
2. Watch P4, then [read P5 by Terry Rossio](https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:J_Fan/Wordplayer.com:_PIRATES_5_Script_%26_Annotations_are_here). It may not be great, but a better version of a fifth film than what we got in 2017, in my opinion anyway. Post-credit scene does have a ""cliffhanger"" of sorts, but going by what was described in the annotations, there is a continuing feel similar to how P3 ended where Barbossa takes the Pearl and Jack has no ship again.

As said, P3 wrapped things quite well. Although I like P4 personally, there is the cliffhanger aspect of the film, which at the time, there was little doubt of a fifth film that may deliver something great. Well, it delivered something, but I can't say it was great. This may be something endlessly debated, whether it was how P4 was developed over time, or the questionable decisions made after the mixed reception, such as replacing the screenwriter who actually knows the universe.",CJS-JFan

Hmm, I don't know which descriptions you are referring to. Barbossa was in all five films and among the top credited cast of characters in four of them. The exception of course being P2, where he was dead and resurrected by the end of the film by Tia Dalma. If P4 didn't feature Barbossa as much, it could have been due to keeping the revenge against Blackbeard motive a surprise. And I definitely can't see the less competent and badass being an issue, though I guess maybe someone was underestimating the one-legged man against the pirate all pirates fear.

Granted, I'm sure those who don't like P4 may say differently somehow. Barbossa wasn't the pirate we knew from P1-3, being a privateer, but he was still a capable pirate through it all, and in character. Arguably the best character in the film, after all.",CJS-JFan

""[Badass Decay](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay): In contrast to his more meticulous [Chessmaster](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster) planning from previous movies Barbossa is very out of element during this installment. He's introduced to the movie by being easily outsmarted by both Jack and Gibbs ([out of all the possible characters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson)) and it only gets slightly better from there. He manages to manipulate his Navy crew but his poor leadership leads to almost all of them dead which proves to be an disadvantage once he has to face the Spandiards and Blackbeard's crew. To top it all, he has a rather poor showing in his only fight in the movie against Blackbeard and only wins by stab him with a poisonus sword once Blackbeard got distracted by the Spandiards. He thankfully does recover his badassery in [*Dead Men Tell No Tales*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanDeadMenTellNoTales)""

""Base-Breaking Character: Many didn't like the way Barbossa was turned into a privateer for most of the movie, feeling like it took away the essence of the character (a pirate who was trying to gain his freedom turned into a Privateer who served the Crown) and feel he suffered from [Badass Decay](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay) as a result. The fact that he has less screentime than in the first and third movies didn't help. Whereas others (including [Geoffrey Rush](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffreyRush)) feel that this was a new and interesting facet of the character which also made sense with how Barbossa would handle this particular situation, and if anything he returned to his pirate ways at the end of the movie.""

As far as if certain storylines truly worked or not, it is subjective and depends on who you ask. My opinion, for what it is worth:

>He manages to manipulate his Navy crew but his poor leadership leads to almost all of them dead which proves to be an disadvantage once he has to face the Spandiards and Blackbeard's crew. To top it all, he has a rather poor showing in his only fight in the movie against Blackbeard and only wins by stab him with a poisonus sword once Blackbeard got distracted by the Spandiards.

I call bull on this. The ""very out of element"" is precisely what was intended. You could say he was outwitted by Gibbs in burning the map, but there are factors to consider. Barbossa knew Gibbs well enough, as Jack's first mate, that he was more than a fool. Although one can't rule out the likelihood that his ""You fool!"" reaction was legitimate, but still. Even the bit about his ""poor leadership"" is questionable: a) The British crew were pawns at best, and b) Barbossa knew there was a chance that he might not win against Blackbeard, hence the poison dart frogs used for his sword - ""Just a scratch and you're a dead man in minutes.""

>Many didn't like the way Barbossa was turned into a privateer for most of the movie, feeling like it took away the essence of the character (a pirate who was trying to gain his freedom turned into a Privateer who served the Crown) \[...\] The fact that he has less screentime than in the first and third movies didn't help. Whereas others (including Geoffrey Rush) feel that this was a new and interesting facet of the character which also made sense with how Barbossa would handle this particular situation, and if anything he returned to his pirate ways at the end of the movie.""

I think I covered ""screentime"" already more or less, though I should add that it is unfair to compare the third film, which is the longest in the series thus far. But what is the essence of the character if not going through things he would normally not do, or deal with people he may not really want to deal with, to achieve his goals? Using P3 as an example: ""Don't you forget \[...\] why I could not leave Jack to his well-deserved fate. And why I could not give Sao Feng a second smile in his throat to match that ineffably smug one that he wears on his face.""

Whereas here, he is in a more or less desperate situation. When Barbossa lost his leg and lost the Black Pearl, he was without a ship, and being crippled had few options, his standing among other pirates would be lowered. His best best for revenge was to approach the British and offer his services as privateer.

>""Captain Obvious Reveal: Barbossa not really meaning his transition into becoming a Privateer and serving King George II, with his only interest being on getting revenge on Blackbeard is treated as a huge surprise, but everything leading up to this scene pretty much telegraphied The Reveal already, we know the Black Pearl it's among Blackbeard's trophies, we know a ""one-legged man"" it's destined to defeat him and we know that the Barbossa from the previous movies would have never gave up on piracy unless he was planning something else.""

Yeah, remember my previous comment about how much was developed onscreen versus being revealed behind-the-scenes? Like how did Barbossa find Blackbeard? How does he know about the importance of Blackbeard's sword? (on that note, nothing to do with making Ships in Bottles, btw) It is like that, but instead of a DVD commentary or some piece of official media to go on, it was a fan question providing the full details. Which isn't bad, for the most part, but I'll admit it probably doesn't help this particular argument. Even the early reveal of a ""one-legged man"" is a bit tongue-in-cheek if one is expecting it to be that big of a reveal.

But again, I think comments like these are nonsense. ""and we know that the Barbossa from the previous movies would have never gave up on piracy unless he was planning something else."" It certainly doesn't make sense, because he did give up on piracy by planning something else: revenge, to the degree of killing a man and taking his possessions. Of course, would it be something all fans be happy with? Surely not, but have better excuses than it being ""out of character"" which is further from the truth...at least in this film.",CJS-JFan

Plus there's the insane Depp fandom who wouldn't accept a Pirates movie without Jack Sparrow in it, even though his character/personality had become dried up (no pun intended) by the latest film and he himself doesn't wanna come back (and Will/Elizabeth were the main characters originally anyway). There's reasons to connect it from an audience standpoint, it'll be a hard sell for general audiences anyway given how swashbuckler films aren't easy sellers and it's not like the franchise NEEDS a full clean slate.......

But artistically speaking, I think a full reboot is a good idea. The OG five films got so complicated and had so many characters and storylines that any writer would find it a hard thing to build upon, so just dispensing of all of it would be an easier task. Plus it would allow them to basically just spend time trying to write the best movie possible rather than appease fans or play along with the mythology/formula. New blood and new life would honestly do the franchise good.

Also, it's called ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", you don't need to be shackled to the same characters or new characters linked to old characters so much. Introduce new Pirates and get the audience to care. Finally, fans who love the OG trilogy I think would rather those films stay untouched and unreturned to especially given how less popular 4 and 5 were. We already got attempts to play on audience nostalgia with 5 anyway and it didn't really win people over then.

And it is hard to say one way or another because we really don't know what their plans are exactly beyond making at least one new movie. Unfortunately, whether it all works out or becomes another pirate fail, who can say?

Yes, it can be agreed that POTC isn't the ""Jack Sparrow franchise"", although I've made arguments about how Disney put themselves into that trap over the years. And of course, having a new movie, with a new storyline, and new characters can work. It has been done in other franchises, both successfully and unsuccessfully, and may or may not work. Artistically speaking, it would have made more sense to try and say prequel or spin-off rather than full on reboot.

However, even with P4-5, there has been the so-called ""new blood and new life"". Sure, it can be argued that those films were standalone sequels compared to reboots, but still, P5 didn't exactly show they cared about the established lore. Which I think is a problem with a reboot: we've had 20 years of story creation and world building just to start from scratch. Now you say a reboot should have a clean slate because the OG five films got so complicated...but what about every other equally-complicated franchise with more than five films? That is my personal concern on that subject. Granted, it may be a ""easier to mess up a reboot than a sequel"" situation, but it may not be as easy as one may think...maybe.

Sure, they can create something that may be good, but will it be as successful as the first film alone OR be strong enough to carry a franchise? There's the rub. You can try new and appease the old franchise fans without diminishing the world that fans fell in love with in the first place. Granted, reboots are inevitable, but with a franchise set in ""our world"" like POTC where reboots shouldn't be possible compared to DC/Marvel...that is concerning.

I'm hopeful Disney/Bruckheimer can deliver something, but I'm unsure if it will be as good as one would hope. 2003-2007 (arguably to 2011-2017) was the rare age that pirate films weren't considered a joke or failures in the making.

Despite the success of POTC, there really wasn't another franchise like it to either pick up it's subgenre or replace it. There's nothing that it really had to compete with or anything. It's basically the only Pirate based Franchise, so it could afford to go in a different direction.

Edit: As for other franchises just as complicated that were more than 5 films, obviously some of them are just more successful and have more momentum, but some of them also do reboots or soft reboots around then anyway.

Otherwise, for now at least, I can't see this so-called ""reboot"" working. Personally speaking, I think separating continuties as ""legends"" may be the way they're likely to go, but I don't think it's entirely ideal because documenting it all will be a mess.

Although, regarding the idea of coordinating various works, I suspect that is never going to happen. Disney did do it for a time, notably with the 2011 novel The Price of Freedom by A.C. Crispin, not to say that the book had zero contradictions to canon, but the effort to keep it all connected was there. And hell, even Star Wars is struggling with their canon, more so now under Disney's charge, and that franchise have a bit more freedom and with a more loyal, or rather more dedicated, fanbase. And even then, including Star Trek which went to different territories, continuities, and new characters, they went back with the old crew. Disney isn't going to put the effort into something unless they're sure it gives them money. Granted, it is the same with POTC, but still, we won't know how a POTC series will work under current circumstances, because Disney did their best making Jack Sparrow the central character for the past 20 years - and reasonably so, because it would make sense to take advantage of the still-living talent as I argue why Star Wars hasn't gone past the Skywalker Saga timeframe as much yet. Whereas with the POTC franchise now, I feel they're just going to reboot everything and somehow make it to where the last 20+ years (i.e. five films and God knows how much media) never happened - unlikely as it may be, it is possible that is their intent.

Some franchises can get away with reboots and such. Maybe POTC can, but again, it isn't as easy as rebooting DC/Marvel or any universe that has a concept like time travel, alternate realities or multiverses where reboots would make sense. Keeping the current canon isn't a bad thing, because it makes one ask, ""If you (Disney) don't care about keeping the consistency of the franchise, why should I?""

Overall, yes, it is hard to say for now either way. We won't know what works, what doesn't, and ultimately if it is worth believing in, when the previous content was more beloved.",CJS-JFan

One of my all time favorite villains. Mostly because of Bill Nighy and the concept of the character, but also because he just looks so damn real. Dead Man's Chest is an awesome movie and just as good as Curse of the Black Pearl imo. I still enjoyed At World's End although not as good, and On Stranger Tides I always viewed as kind of an alright epilogue to the trilogy. Dead Men Tell No Tales I try to pretend was an unrelated fever dream. But Dead Man's Chest had the best special effects of all of them.

The scene where the Kraken takes down the ship that Will is on and it’s completely silent until the tentacles smash the ship in half and the organ kicks! Holy shit that was amazing to watch!

motion hides a lot of it, for sure... but some of the close ups with people I could not suspend the disbelief because the surfaces were just too different from a resolution standpoint



I was personally surprised that VFX corridor crew thought it was so great but I suspect they have other reasons for cherrypicking some of the best out of it.

The story was eh, but it held enough together to make it enjoyable, the rest of the cast killed it (the last thing I think Johnny Depp was good at, that I've seen of course), and last but not least, the fucking OST. 

Pirates one and two had amazing music but Hans Zimmer blew me away with dead man's chest. Second best OST of his next to interstellar IMO.

Second, you said it looked *literally* real to you. That it didn't take you out of your suspension of disbelief at any moment. Personally, I don't see it. His face has the classic specular highlights of a CG animation. Maybe it's because I have a degree in CG...but I honestly don't think it is.

Don't get me wrong, he looks great, but he also looks VERY fake to me. So do the rest of the crew. I remember when I watched it being surprised to see such a cartoony set of characters. I mean they all look so classic Disney style; something you might see in their theme park rides.

You also mentioned nothing competing in terms of entirely CG characters. But someone else here mentioned it already: District 9. 

To me the prawns are far superior and that was the first movie where I didn't just have a lack of suspension, but I actually was in disbelief that they looked SO REAL. I think the same goes for most of WETA workshop's work. Their robots in Elysium and Chappie were killer. The specular highlights were spot on, and none of it looked CG to me.",Shinji246

For a movie that debuted in 2003, the final fight scene in Isla de Muerta, as they swordfight and swashbuckle between candlelight and moonlight, transitioning from flesh to skeleton and back was better and, more importantly, *more convincing* than either of the final two Avengers movies.

Dead Man's Chest should be kept in a hall of fame and shown on public television on all channels at least once a year. It so beautifully stays faithful to the craft of cinema, and there is a true magic about the entire affair.

IMO the movie that has the best CGI overall is the most recent planet of the apes movie (War for Planet of the Apes).

Those blue alien people.

They were... **literally**... no improvement over the gungans in _Episode 1_ from 1999.

This wasn't even subtle, either.  There were many shots where the camera would swap between a closeup of a human actor and a closeup of a blue alien face.  The human actor would have believable head motions and physical movements and such.  All they had to do was try to mimic that.  But nope.  The alien heads are mostly static and share that floaty quality almost all CGI has.  Especially the lips, which move as though they just got back from the dentist and still have a few hours of total face numbness to look forward to.

Why bring up issues with a movie from eight years ago?

Because Groot and Rocket Raccoon share those issues.  Just really bad character animation.

It seems only the highest artistry is capable of doing this aspect of CGI justice.  Anyone have any examples of what they feel are well-done specimens?",Fredasa

Two of those times were within a day of eachother. I remember loving At Worlds End as well and being completely surprised and a bit offended when I heard so many people saying they didnt like the third installment because it was long. That said I wish we could normalize long movies like that. I remember when Endgame came out last year it felt like the studio and every blog and article i saw on it was complaining or apologizing about its length but like if it was an hour longer I'd have still sat through it?? Same goes for the original 3 pirates of the Caribbean movies. I would have watched them at any length. They're fantastic.,TheProfesseyWillHelp

The blend of CG and practical effects and stunts and action scenes are impeccable! The music is amazing, Johnny Depp was at the height of his popularity and he had so much energy and passion for the role still. (He wasn't sleepwalking through his movies yet...) Even then Bill Nighy steals every scene his in! Davy Jones might be the most impressive CG character ever made.

But Jones was my favorite character; not only because he's a visual masterpiece but because he's just a great *character*. I'd hesitate to call him a villain because he is only malicious out of pure human qualities and not like Beckett, who is driven by desires of business. If you think about it, most of the villains in the *POTC* universe exist because of their human flaws and needs.

Nighy was great at being Jones. I swear every time I watch this movie, there are more animated details to pick out. I can't believe his tentacles are *all CGI* and the scene where Will gets the key, they had to motion-track his acting to make the tentacles flow well.

It's not because the first movie is somehow more lighthearted that people prefer it; I don't even get where that idea comes from. It's because Curse of the Black Pearl is an absolute paragon of structure and economical storytelling. This tightness is partly a result of the film being originally conceived as a self-contained work, as it means everything gets to be set up and paid off before the credits roll.

Almost every scene is both distinctly memorable and accomplishes many things at once, communicating so much about the characters and setting from so many different angles so elegantly, often wordlessly, that a lot of the time you don't even realize the information you're absorbing until it comes back around later. Perhaps most impressive is that it does all this while maintaining a strong sense of narrative momentum. The jokes consistently land, but the movie also knows when it's earned a moment to let the drama breathe in earnest. It builds and builds on itself to a wonderful supernatural twist midway through which keeps the viewer on their toes and frames everything in a new light, clearing the deck for a climax in which every thread neatly weaves together.

Each character is dynamic and well-realized, even the distant secondary antagonist of Elizabeth's prospective husband who would have been so, so easy to write as a totally generic one-note asshole. Yet in the end when Elizabeth tells him she doesn't want to marry him, he just... respects her wishes. And as primary villain, Barbossa is both properly sinister and sympathetic. His fate is surprisingly bittersweet and places the focus squarely on the figure's humanity. Elizabeth and Will are strong leading characters who display a lot of growth over the story. And Jack stands above them all as a true wildcard; the character is simply magnetic. It isn't random that he instantly launched into pop culture immortality following this first appearance, and I don't think he ever again feels as enigmatic as he does here. 

Curse of the Black Pearl is a perfect example of a *smart* adventure movie that never condescends to its audience but also never loses sight of fun, and it fully deserves to be ranked alongside the all-time greats of its genre.",King_Allant

I think that if something as bold as those two sequels was made today, people's minds would litterally melt, after years of being subjected to the mediocrity of the Marvel standards that has spread and contaminated almost all blockbusters. And the same holds with many professional reviewers who said 'meh' back then but now award 4 or 5 star to each MCU movie.

Another thing you didnt mention, is the steep quality increase of the music. Hans Zimmer and his team rushed something in 2 weeks for the first movie, but the way they expanded it on DMC and especially AWE, truly was mindblowing. The Kraken theme, Davy Jones' theme, the whole new Jack Sparrow suite for the 2nd movie... and the 3rd movie's love theme is the most heartbreakingly beautiful thing he has written to this day. Those 2 movies are just full of musical treasures, with surprisingly few straight rehash of the famous themes from the 1st movie.",-Ds---

It is what lead to the tech of Planet of the Apes, The Jungle Book, Game of Thrones,  His Dark Materials, etc. where you have tons of humans interacting directly with the characters.

Davy Jones has additional animation for all his animal aspects (his tentacles have rules of their own for movement and weight and manipulation of the environment), is shot on a moving ship (already one of the hardest things to shoot in film), and often in conditions that mean pouring rain on the actors (rain can be good for disguising effects for full CGI characters but less so when filming humans in the condition) - in addition to having a skin texture that's slimy and reflective (and constantly moving thanks to those tentacles) and in addition, the character is a tragic one you're meant to feel for - in the old-fashioned romantic sense of it, he's the 'tortured soul' type with watery eyes.

I believe Jackson originally hired Del Toro to do a new take on Middle-Earth, even if it was just aesthetically.  When he left the project, it caused a shit storm as Warner Bros was racing to get the movie into production before they lost the film-rights back to the Tolkein family.

If the VFX team can be supplied with ALL of the proper information from the scene that they are working with, the level of detail and seamless compositing that can be done is spectacular. Even from a relatively small team.

When a gun hoe director isn't taking the time to let the VFX teams gather that information with special tools and equipment, they end up having to approximate thode values in post and ""eyeball it""...leading to tiny and subtle inaccuracies in everything from light levels, character positionings, animations, lense corrections and distortions etc. The list goes on.

Watch the Gallimimus stampede scene and the kitchen raptor scene and be reminded that it's still early 90s CGI. Early CGI looks great when it's obfuscated by rain and darkness. 

Now Starship Troopers, now that's a movie that has CGI during daylight scenes and somehow still looks great.",DireLackofGravitas

Here's a quote from an interview w Terry Rossio, one of the writers:

> INTERVIEWER: I believe you were specifically involved in writing the supernatural curse of the Black Pearl. Tell me about your experience developing that from the Disneyland ride.

> ROSSIO: One funny moment came during story development, regarding the skeleton pirates in the moonlight. We knew we wanted to have sword-fighting skeletons from the start because those were cool and already part of the ride. But we also wanted to see the actor's faces, you don't want to make Geoffrey Rush into a skeleton for an entire film. So, the natural idea would be to do it like in Ladyhawke, pirates by day, skeletons by night.

> But the producers shook their heads. With all the nighttime fight scenes, CGI was expensive at the time. We couldn't afford for the pirates to be skeletons all night long. I was sitting at the table and laughed out loud. Everyone looked at me. ""What if the pirates are skeletons at night, but only when the moon comes out? Can we get away with that?"" They loved it. ""Yes! When the budget gets tight, we just put a cloud in front of the moon!"" And that's what we did.

Also, there's this sort of overly-serendipitous trope that the movies do that's sort of charming, but it goes overboard in this part.

This plan was created by Calypso who brought [Barbossa back from the dead](https://youtu.be/6oHe8lS0Huo?t=42) in the first place to engineer and get the pieces of 8 that bound her to human form in the first place. They are on the fourth Brethren Court by this time in POTC history. However Calypso secretly wanted revenge on the brethren court and planned on [killing them all once](https://youtu.be/511HV5Vb5vI?t=175) freed since she was a Goddess of the sea and can change forms so one form is [torture for her for so long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=511HV5Vb5vI). But then it was revealed Davy Jones who was the man she fell in love with and betrayed by not being there for him when the 10 years of the Dutchman was up and they could reunite was the one who taught and showed the [First Brethren court](https://youtu.be/gwfCO_1pxl0?t=106) how to trap her in the first place so when she was finally freed she was angry at both and became a chaotic neutral type and became that maelstrom they had the final battle in since both sides were both responsible for her entrapment and the pain she suffered being stuck in one form. Which is where I think some people got lost and confused about in the end. 

[From DMC setting it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADtyN0G5G3c). They also specifically [framed](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/b0t63c/detail_in_pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans/) a scene to show the crab music locket box Calypso had that also Davy Jones had one too. You can see it in DMC when Tia Dalma goes into the back to get the Jar of Dirt for Jack Sparrow and he steals a ring next to the [locket](https://youtu.be/D55WWSBwSks?t=32). For Davy Jones starting at [13 seconds](https://youtu.be/L0JbaZtoKAs?t=11) in when he is playing the organ and the same tune planes in DMC and later ATW from both their lockets. The song Davy Jones is playing is a sped up version on the organ.

>Tia Dalma: **You know of Davy Jones, yes? [the Crew nods] A man of the sea. A great Sailor. Until he run afoul of that which vex all men.** [Jack pockets something while no one’s looking]

>Will: What vexes all men?

>Tia Dalma: [she teasingly touches Will’s hand] What indeed.

>Gibbs: **The sea?**

>Pintel: Sums.

>Ragetti: The dichotomy of good and evil. [Gibbs and Pintel give him a look]

>Jack: **A woman!**

>Tia Dalma: **A woman. He fell in love.**

>Gibbs: **No no no no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with**.

>Tia Dalma:**Same story, different version and all are true. See it was a woman as changing, and harsh and untamable as the sea. He never stopped loving her. But the pain it caused him was too much to live with. But not enough to cause him to die.**

>Will: What exactly did he put into the chest?

>Tia Dalma: [puts hand upon her breast] Him heart.

>Ragetti: Literally or figuratively?

>Pintel: He couldn’t live, putting his heart in a chest. Could he?

>Tia Dalma: It was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings. And so, him carved out him heart, lock it down in a chest, and hide the chest from the world. The key he keep with him at all times.

A prime example of how a studio swung big and made bold choices without compromising the craft of the art.,fqshynj,2020-05-16 05:43:00,"Del Toro was working on the script with Jackson & his team.  And given everything Jackson was saying about it at the time, it felt like he was hoping to pass off the reigns & become more passive in his involvement as a writer/producer.  When Guillermo left just months before filming was set to begin, there wasn't really much that Jackson could do to salvage it.  The studio had an immovable deadline that needed to be met, so it was either push through with what they had already or scrap the project all together.  While the critic in me might've preferred the latter, there was just no way to get out of it at that point without eating great financial loss given that they already had contracts in play & people on reserve waiting to start working on the film.  




Not blaming anyone, obviously, be it Guillermo Del Toro, Peter Jackson, or the studio themselves as all were just looking out for their own best interests.  But I think the general public *really* takes for granted just how special the LOTR trilogy was.  It was getting pitched for over 50 years before it ended up getting made.  No one considered it to be filmable.  Even with all of the technical advancements we had made by the late 90s, movie studios were still trepidatious at the idea.  Then, based on the feedback that they had already given to Jackson, he & his team were originally pressured into selling LOTR as one or, **at most**, two movies until they met the people at New Line who said, ""But it's three books?  It should be a trilogy of films.""  The bigwigs understood the marketing implications of releasing 3 movies back-to-back-to-back, and that the greatest payoff from all of this would only come with great patience & even greater effort.  And, even then, it still took them years to develop & prepare before shooting even began after that.  All of that juxtaposed with The Hobbit, a single book, being stretched out into three movies before the clock could strike 12 and they'd lose any future chance of squeezing that particular IP's teat dry.

Warner had actually even planned for it, getting Jackson/Del Toro on board to begin developing *The Hobbit* a few years before they legally needed to start production.  Then, during that time, the MGM stuff & a buncha other shit I imagine happened, thus delaying their work further.  And, like you said, eventually Del Toro grew impatient & peaced the fuck outta there.  But by the time he left and WB was finally ready to go at it again, they were left with only like a year to start filming before the rights would revert back to Tolkein's estate.  So, Peter Jackson begrudgingly stepped up and cobbled together what he could by adding and subtracting from another one-of-a-kind creator's ideas.

But the tech just wasn't there, and it needs a really thorough remaster to make some aspects (Yoda, the droids, the clones) look a lot better. Episode III does a good job on a lot of the clones, but you can't help but think ""actually, this armour needs to be physical like the storm troopers"".

There's also other challenges, like Ewan McGregor & others literally acting against a green screen. Those can't be fixed sadly.

I always like to take the thought that basically, given the time and money, the director could of fulfilled their vision. Star wars looks great today, and the problems with the prequels isn't limited to dated CGI. It's also to a script that managed to make Oscar winners very wooden.",Hirmetrium

Lucas also founded Industrial Light and Magic, which did the spefial effects of Dead Man's Chest which this thread is about.

""Lazy"" is the last word anybody should use to describe Lucas. He is a tinkerer. He is never satisfied with his work. He is constantly trying to push what can be done beyond what is reasonable for the time. His own films have variously succeeded or floundered because of that drive.

The man built his own film empire. He fought against the studios, the directors guild, etc. Lucas is the reason why we don't sit through 5 to 15 minutes of credits at the *beginning* of movies.

The dude literally fought an uphill battle and revolutionalized almost every aspect of modern filmmaking. He suffered from exhaustion, and his wife left him in part because he was too busy focused on his new film empire.

Yeah, his own movies have dated technology. It's befause he pushed the envelope for experimental and new technology. The first uses of CGI in movies were Lucas. The first digitally filmed movie, Lucas. FOX Australia exists because of Lucas.

The dude literally revolutionized how movies are merchandised. He took a huge gamble on it and everyone thought he was stupid, but he built a multi-billion dollar company out of it. There has literally been SW merchandise in major stores, consistently, for close to 50 years now.

Like Pixar ane fully CGI movies? Give Lucas some credit. Like the mogies that pioneered CGI like Jurassic Park? Give Lufas some credit. Like movies like Dead Man's Chest that still hold up? Give Lucas a little credit.

You can show A New Hope or the prequels to people today who will find them dated, boring, etc. The reason for that is that so many filmmakers were inspired by Lucas that they carried his torch and lit it even brighter. Every envelope that he pushed has been lovingly pushed even further by hundreds of other creative people.",Holmgeir

When the pioneering work gets done, it's because the director and the entire crew are in on the plans. The VFX teams get to do it ""by the book"" so to speak (even if they're writing the book whilst they do it). The end product is usually utterly mind blowing and of a quality not seen before. 

Unfortunately though, as soon as such a technical achievement is made or new VFX ground is broken, all of a sudden hundreds of other studios need to try and deliver the same product or risk losing business. They then undercut each other, fudge and fake their way to try and produce a similar look which is rarely as good. Money talks, so those fudged skills are the ones that survive. 

All this does is dig an ever deeper hole for the industry, making sure other teams rarely get given the time needed to make the art truly shine. The cost and time to get it done properly is usually met with ""well X company did it for half that price, didn't need half this many personnel and didn't need to hold up my shoot schedule to take pictures of shiny balls.""

They built some really nice interior sets of the Air and Space Museum in a freaking ship hanger to fit in all the replica rockets and planes. That Air and Space Museum set was humongous with how tall and wide it was. They also rebuilt the original American Museum of Natural History lobby set since they demolished the original one after the first film. The National Museum of Natural History and also The Castle set was built. The production designer Claude Paré in the BTS was going over the set and it was crazy. For Amelia Earheart's plane he acknowledged that the door opens on the wrong side and it is on purpose because the director wanted it to open the other way for a scene later in the movie, but he wanted to say ahead of time that yes he knows it opens on the other side.",waitingtodiesoon

RotK was the first fantasy/sci-fi/horror movie ever to win the Oscar for best movie. Not even Kubrik, Hitchcock or Spielberg had managed that before. 

I take this as an indication how it has contributed to the change of our perception of fantastical stories as stuff for children and nerds to something that can have proper artistic merit.

The Lotr movies also incredibly contributed to fantasy/ geek culture finding it's way into the mainstream, basically paving the way for Harry Potter, Marvel, GoT etc. I still remember when Lotr movies came out, suddenly you could see women reading the books everywhere, because now suddenly fantasy either started to appeal more to women or made it socially more acceptable.

>It’s a good story, but there’s one problem: Bob Shaye himself has said that it’s bunch of baloney. “I didn’t say, ‘Aren’t there three books’ or whatever,” Shaye later said in an interview for the book, Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker’s Journey. Shaye was thinking more in terms of business than in terms of Tolkien. “I was cognizant of my discussions with Michael Lynn about our need for sequels. I knew that, after conferring with Michael… we were going to make three films.”

>“Bob was getting pretty excited,” New Line executive Mark Ordesky said about the meeting, “because he sees what Peter was saying artistically, but because he’s also seeing three video releases, three network television sales…”

>Interestingly, turning The Lord of the Rings from two films to three films would turn out to be quite the challenge for the writers. (In retrospect, maybe four would have been better!)

You're right in everything you said, which is what makes LOTR one of if not *the* biggest trendsetter of modern cinema.  My point is simply how people are so used to a saga of movies all being made at once like Pirates of the Carribean or Avatar or the Matrix.  They're used to a single franchise consuming the entire zeitgeist for 2 or 3 years like with Marvel's Infinity War & Endgame.  They've seen the big third-act battle scenes.  They expect long-term character development over the course of multiple films as if it were television.  



And yet, there are many who don't realize how much of these expectations are due to the success of LOTR.  And there are even more in positions of great power who don't realize *why* those movies work and their's do not.  And It's because, from the moneybags to the PAs, that entire trilogy was a labor of love

Lmao in America mate, in america. Western Europe is LOTR, China doesn't give a fuck about Star Wars, and everywhere else it's just a film series.


""Look at how many more"" Give the numbers then, you make a statement - back it up. 


You forget that the Lord of the Rings has been around for a substantially longer time, in the form of the books. In terms of most beloved universe of all time, Star wars is far from being considered that especially since the Tolkien Universe  has already been around and cherished by people since the 1950's (that is 70 years, a sizeable legendarium, multiple republications, translation into 38 different languages, and 3 massive films). Harry Potter has more bloody international appeal than Star Wars, and Marvel is slowly creeping in as the current generation's 'Star Wars'.

The reality is that Star Wars has not been good since the 80's, it's just a commercial Juggernaut propped up by Disney. It's extremely popular in the States, but that does not translate world wide - Marvel/LOTR/Harry Potter are currently more popular/beloved.

Come to think of it, the actual most 'beloved' universe is Harry Potter, as it dominated two forms of media, whilst maintaining a high level of artistic merit/quality. Only 3 of the 9 star wars films could be compared in terms of craft to the Harry Potter series, and again those were back in the 80's.",

The guy SAYS IN THE MOVIE that he doesn't look at their faces ON PURPOSE because he knows if he lets himself see them in a dream, he'll stay in it.

The only time the dwarves are all conclusively male in the book is when Gandalf laughs and says they look like grandfathers with their beards, when they are in the tree. But even then it doesn't necessarily mean every single one of them was bearded. And even so, the Two Towers movie made a joke that dwarf women are often confused for men becsuse of their beards.

The movie went out of its way to make up a woman elf — a character which is adapted from the elf captain of the guard in the book, who is definitely male — and they missed a perfeft opportunity to hire an entire handful of women and to help distinguish the dwarves at the same time.",Holmgeir

I don't think that's really true with a couple exceptions. Thorin and the dwarf gang is exactly what most of them are portrayed as in the books - for a good portion of them, having a name that rhymes with the dwarf named before them and after them is the extent of their personalities.

And of course that's all ""Legends"" now, but modern Lucasfilm/Disney is doing there darndest to catch up. Questions of quality continue, but some of it is apparently still pretty good.

Now, again, I don't think you're wrong that Star Wars is definitely more of an American thing than a worldwide thing, but the Star Wars movies alone have made over 9 billion dollars, coming in just above Harry Potter. That excludes all other merchandising and media. Including the whole media franchise as a whole it's somewhere around 70 billion dollars, double that of Marvel and over double that of Harry Potter.

They have a lot of behind the scenes footage which really highlight how much George was sort of coasting along for AOTC and ROTS. He was happy to let most of the movie be shot on green screen and he had complete control of the script. 


For example, I think he only finished a first draft of the script for ROTS a few weeks before filming began, which is absurd.

I think it took a bit of the romance out of the films for me. There was no real diversity to the sets and backdrops. Compare it to how he made the OT, where he spent weeks in the desert or how they filmed the Hoth scenes in Norway.",HanSoloHeadBeg

This scene needed Aragorn to do *something*. Every main living character needed their story to crescendo with their biggest challenge. Gandalf - who instilled courage in everyone else for so long couldn't let his falter, he still needed to give people a push; Merry & Pippin not only show they can hold their own, but are second and third into battle; Frodo & Sam have to deal with the most evil thing in the world in it's own fucking house, etc. 

While another medium like a novel may be fine having Aragorn look  to the tower, or the volcano, or deep within himself and remember everything that has lead up to that moment -- on screen you need a visual representation of this. That's why the original draft had toyed with having him duel the apparition of Sauron. We've just seen this guy spend two weeks running across country killing orcs, he slaughtered Uruks at Helm's Deep, he casually won an army of ghosts to help him, he cut his way across Pelennor fields... If he were just to hack away at some other grunts there is quite little tension. Yes, we're cross cutting with Frodo and Sam's biggest challenge, but to then go back and see more-of-the-same with the seemingly invincible Man, Elf and Dwarf hacking more orcs, it lacks any progression of threat. When they realized why fighting Sauron made no sense, they thought ""well, what the hell can we throw at Aragorn?"" and a plausible answer is a Troll. It took the whole Fellowship to kill one troll in #1, so it's established as a formidable threat.

[That last bit I do have a source on.] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2014/07/22/fourth-pirates-of-the-caribbean-is-most-expensive-movie-ever-with-costs-of-410-million/#54474edc364f)

It's similar why Uwe Boll could keep making movies after the spectacular failure that was ""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" ($60m budget/$13m BO), albeit a sneakier version. A German tax break loophole basically negated the loss, so he could just keep making movies. The loophole has since been rectified, and Uwe Boll has retired (or has he??)",irlcatspankz

WHY DID THEY NEED THAT MUCH MONEY?!",dhvow8f,2017-05-22 09:31:01,"I do biology research, some on water and some on land, and a similar thing happens in the grant budgets in that boat-based grants regularly come in 50% more expensive or higher. Three main reasons: 

One, time lost to weather. On water you not only have to wait for clear skies but also *no wind* and often the right tide and low waves (low Beaufort sea state, highly connected to wind). I never used to pay attention to wind but now, if I feel a puff of wind, an alarm bell goes off in my head about ""Is the wind picking up? Are we gonna lose our sea state? Do we have to head in?"" (It's a major safety concern in small vessels since they can run into real trouble fast in big waves - a normal work day can go from routine to life-threatening in a single hour if the wind changes.)  I look at those Pirates movies and I can see they are only filming at sea states 0, 1 and maybe 2; so any day with 3 or above, they clearly couldn't go out. In my last project we managed to get only 7 days on the water out of a total of 60 days on site. And that was a good season. The other 53 days the entire crew was stuck on land due to some combination of wind, fog, rain, and sea state. The whole time everybody was still being paid & still needed food & housing.

Two, you keep losing position. Water is always sliding you around. Nothing stays goddam PUT; it's infuriating. So you have to CONSTANTLY burn fuel just to re-maneuver back into position and then hold position. This goes triple if you're trying to maintain a certain distance from other vessels (which are also drifting around). You lose a lot of time maneuvering, and fuel costs are insane. It's a given in biology that boat projects cost almost as much as air-based research (helicopter/plane based aerial projects) because of the constant fuel burn.

Three, you have the full boat crew *in addition to* your regular crew. For me it instantly doubles the # of people (and salary is always the biggest cost). I can take a 2 person team into a remote rugged mountain area with just a crappy 20 year old rented pickup and get more done, in fewer days, than with 4-5 people in a good new boat.",NorthernSparrow

Whether that's true for any particular case is another matter. Also it needs to be very clear on whether this includes marketing or not, the production budgets you can get of say boxofficemojo do not but someone stating ""total cost"" may be including marketing. 

Also important to keep in mind is they aren't inflating the numbers and even on the low ball we can estimate profits can be much less then the raw box office may imply. So like [SuperBat](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=superman2015.htm) would have to have a fairly small marketing budget to actually get out of the red.

Domestically, for example, Disney likely only saw about 75% of the $240 Million domestic box office for PotC4, which would be $180 million. Studios receive much less from the foreign box office, closer to 50% of PotC4's $800 million, or $400 million, will actually go back to Disney.

Adding those together gives Disney about $580 Million from ticket sales. If OP is correct and the film actually cost $379 million to produce, the marketing, which for a major tentpole film like PotC4 is another 30%, and Disney's cost ends up closer to $493 Million. 

$580,000,000 - $493,000,000 = $88 Million

While $88 Million would be a lot of money to most people, spending $439 million to make $88 million is quite a leap of faith. If the film had done poorly in any major territory, it may have lost Disney money. ",boy1der1983

* Jack Sparrow was never made to be a main character. As a side character/comic relief he was fine, but once the spotlight is solely on him, his main flaw comes out: it is impossible to develop him further as a character.
* The film absolutely mutilated Barbossa, one of the cooler characters from the other movies.

I thought it was enjoyable, but hardly comparable to the original. The plot felt way too convenient most times; Mutany on your hands? Just summon magic ropes to tie everyone up. Surrounded on all sides by the British? Just drop through a trap door right below you. No way to get back in the Spanish camp to get the chalices required to move the plot along? No worries, I actually have them right here. 

The characters were also much less interesting, as you mentioned. The only character that the audience would connect with is Jack, and he is guaranteed not to die. We don't care about Angelica; she's just not as interesting as Elizabeth was in the originals due to the lack of a character like Will. I did enjoy the dynamic between the mermaid and the priest; I justify that in that she is a mermaid, so he has fallen under her spell essentially. I do wonder if he died at the end, or if she saved him.

Blackbeard was actually a pretty good villain, in my opinion; by the end, I really did hate him (choosing your own life over your daughter's?). 

I agree that Depp was trying way too hard to be Sparrow. The line at the very end was what did it for me (when he was explaining how to get the ship out of the bottle). How did you know that? No explanation, no nothing. Kind of minor, but I agree with you.

The action was typical Pirates. It has always been predictable, so it wasn't disappointing. I wasn't expecting Matrix or anything walking in, so...

The music was at least a redeeming factor. As always, Hans Zimmer wrote a magnificent score. Also, I did not see it in 3D, but the film had a LOT of 3D sound effects to make use of a theater's surround sound system, and it was *highly* enjoyable. Everything from the ambiance of a jungle to a bird flying by. There were several scenes that did feel ""made for 3D"", but it didn't ruin the movie by any means.

I'd give it 2/5 stars. See it at the dollar theater or on DVD, but don't pay full price.",

I've always enjoyed the *Pirates of the Caribbean* series; I loved how rotten the villains were. Hector Barbossa is the ultimate badass pirate, then suddenly Davy Jones himself shows up in The Flying Dutchman to remind everyone that there can be even someone even more rotten. I'll admit that Blackbeard was a bit forced with his [spoiler](/s""magical sword that controlled the Queen Anne's Revenge""), but his character was ruthless and convincing of a true ""pirate.""

The whole plot relied on things just happening on coincidence. You mean to tell me that Jack knew EXACTLY where the guard was going to run to slip on the handkerchief? Or that the horse chase would end RIGHT in front of the inn where his father was, who also happened to be outside just in time to kill the guard about to kill Jack? And that when the guards came after that, there would just happen to be a trap door big enough for two people to deposit them into the water? And that Angelica happened to know where THAT led to so that she could have one of the zombie dudes laying in wait to drug Jack? 

It was utterly ridiculous how badly written this script was. Was there a point to introducing a useless missonary guy who falls in love with a mermaid? All I can think of was that they felt they needed some sorta Twilight-ish romance going on. Speaking of mermaids, why did the one grow human legs? They obviously couldn't survive long without water, and none of them used it to go on land to grab the sailors during the action scenes? Was it solely for a scene where the missionary guy takes his shirt off for the girl and carry her in his arms? And why didn't Blackbeard just use his magic boat command powers to wrap one up with rope or a net and bring it aboard, why go through that boring action scene in the first place?

*Trap door to the ocean in a bar that's in the middle of the city nowhere near any body of water.

I'll agree with you on a few things though, I felt like the Sparrow thing got played up a bit, but it was light-hearted for most parts (unless you could really tell they were trying hard). 

It felt the most like the original to me, a contained story with no real attempt to try and make something big out of it. The lack of Orlando and Keira really did it for me, I thought Penelope Cruz was one of the best things to happen to the series. She played a great character that played perfectly off of Depp's. 

While the movie and scenes were sometimes predictable, I didn't go in expecting to be surprised. I actually went in with negative ideas of it and came out loving it. It's pretty close to the first for me, just a good and enjoyable romp through the Pirates world. The only parts that I really didn't like were the King of England's over-done pompousness, the end monologue by Jack, and the Priest just randomly deciding to go shirtless for the whole movie.

It is never implied he can control ropes, but rather his ship.

They specifically say that it gives you all the years he has lived plus the ones he's got to live.

>This book follows the exploits of John ""Jack Shandy"" Chandagnac, who travels to the new world after the death of his puppeteer father to confront his uncle, who apparently has made off with the family inheritance. During the voyage, he gets to know a woman named Beth Hurwood and her father Benjamin Hurwood, an Oxford professor. Before they arrive, their ship is waylaid by pirates and, with the help of the professor and his assistant, the captain is killed and Chandagnac is forced to join the pirate crew. The reader discovers a sinister plot being concocted by the professor involving his dead wife, his living daughter, the Fountain of Youth, and Blackbeard. Chandagnac, now known as ""Jack Shandy"", must put a stop to these plans and save Beth Hurwood.

The movie really is nothing like that aside from the fact that it involves the Fountain of Youth and Blackbeard.

The first one was indeed amazing, I am a supporter of the next two because I enjoy the overarching story. But beyond those 3 the franchise does go through a fundamental shift centering around my next point. The main characters of the film changes to Jack Sparrow. That’s my next personal opinion, Jack Sparrow was part of the main characters but not the focus. In fact the story of the first three movies center almost completely on Will Turner and Elizabeth and Jack is an elevated side character for the most part.

I do think the whole franchise has been unfairly looked down on. While I understand the burn out after the first 4 (and now we’re getting a boringly competent version of Jungle Cruise as a response to the success of PotC), I think history will be more kind to the original trilogy of films.",Skele11

Almost every joke is groan-inducing, and many are tonally way off from an 18th century pirate ""period"" film (""who hurt you?"").

The action is short and uninspired, save maybe one scene. The chance at having a their first truly terrifying villain since Davy Jones is completely wasted, you get the of his dialogue in the trailer, other than that he's mostly mumbling to himself incoherently. Johnny Depp can't even keep his Jack Sparrow accent straight. The ""backstory"" for Jack and how he got his name was the lamest thing they could have come up with, they just have him do one thing, repeat one line, and that was it, that's how he got his name, it made absolutely no sense. The new characters were terrible in their roles, and that probably wasn't their fault, they had the worst script they could possibly work with. It was all about them conveniently breaking all curses and reading an unreadable map which wasn't at all unreadable, just needed to meet certain conditions, like in The Hobbit but worse. They apparently forgot the backstory they set up in previous movies, and other people's comments I've read have tried to justify it by filling in the blank spaces with their thoughts, when in honesty it was bad writing and forgetting what had happened in the previous movies. This movie doesn't stack up to On Stranger Tides, that movie at least had some enjoyable parts. This movie didn't make me actually laugh more than once, and barely got a chuckle from me aside from that, I sat with a blank expression the entire time waiting for the movie to get good, it never did, which probably explains the after credits scene as their only chance to possibly save the franchise, even though that scene doesn't make any sense either after what happens st the end of the movie.

IMO, DMTNT is pretty close to the feel of the original 3; the only exceptions being the plot felt a little lacklustre in some parts, the dialogue could get a little cringey and there were some questionable pivotal plot moments that make you go 'why did that happen?'. But I guess that is to be expected in a 5th iteration of a franchise.

If you go in expecting to be entertained, and not have too much expectations for it to bring you all the way back to the feeling of Pirates 1, then I think you'll have a good time.

movies,h91gq,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides gets a vicious review and a 3/5 from UK's Total Film Magazine,c1tjlai,2011-05-11 18:13:32,"I expected differently because of these few differing elements from the 2nd and 3rd films

- there was a new director
- the movie was actually written before the filming began this time
- there is more focus on the characters people actually care about in this story
- there is NO Bloom and Knightley
- its a simple direct plot with no convulted mess
- its based on a good book

unfortunately, it sounds like these factors don't seem to have made a difference.",dragonzoo

I also agree with the reviewer that Depp's Sparrow, at this point, if you are much older than 8, is, frankly, annoying.  Lot of talented people involved in these movies: they should do us and themselves a favor and move on to fresher pastures.",HarryBridges
