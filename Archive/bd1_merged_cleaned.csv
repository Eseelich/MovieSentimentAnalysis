Personally I had issues with that entire plot point for the mere fact the book makes it painfully obvious what it implies. It makes it even weirder when Jake essentially tells her nothing he felt was for her but he was being drawn to her for her future baby. (Yikes)

For me it would have been better for Jake to love her as a sister. It would change almost nothing in the plot, Jake would still have a reason to be upset with Bella someone he loved as family essentially dying and becoming what he was always taught to distrust/Despise. Then he could simply care for her child the same way. Romantic love isn't the end all be all. 

I just wish certain plot elements were handled with a bit more care.",HelloStarlite

On the original cut, it didn't even really occur to me that Edward knew. But in the extended cut, he did and he threw him into the bookshelf and said something like, ""Protect him,"" to Rose. At this point, I think he knew that if something had happened to the Cullens from the attack, Jake can protect his daughter. It wasn't until Jacob came out to talk to the pack that Edward realized they couldn't harm his daughter because of the imprint and they retreated.

I'm transmasc and I really do think there is something in Twilight that just hits differently for trans people. The whole journey of Bella becoming a fully realized version of herself, and having to leave parts of her old self and life behind in order to do that resonates so much. Also, those she is close with have to change how they interact with her once she becomes a vampire, that shifting of dynamics is interesting too.

1. I think you're over estimating the resources available in a small town. I'd be surprised if they even have a butcher, let alone one that could supply that much blood.¬†


2.¬†I have never ever seen anyone in America serve blood pudding. That alone would raise suspicions¬†


3. Let's set the first two points aside and just focus on quantity. Twilight Vampires drink a LOT of blood. A grizzly or an elk has about 5 gallons of blood. We've seen them hunt multiple animals in a meal so let's say a vampire would drink 10 gallons of blood in a meal. That would be 70 gallons of blood for the entire family. I found a blood pudding recipe that uses 4 cups of blood and yields 3 lbs of pudding, so 70 gallons would be equivalent to 840 lbs of pudding.¬†¬†

I'd imagine that the older the blood is, the less palatable it would be, and a town the size of Forks probably doesn't have a butcher shop in the habit of keeping much blood on hand.

The bigger plot hole as I see it is why is it not considered to supplement their strength using the bagged human blood they already had on hand for Bella's use?

Just because I can't eat junk food all the time doesn't mean it isn't a normal (and perfectly acceptable) part of my diet. As an adult, I find I buy less junk food now than when I was a teenager because the allure has decreased with the additional availability. I can go buy it myself whenever, so I don't need to stockpile candy like a gremlin.

Vampires that drink solely from humans are shown to be capable of retaining basic control around humans, otherwise newborn thirst would be less noteworthy and the Volturi would be unable to keep any humans on staff to act as social go-betweens with the human world. Having the temptation isn't bad. Acting on that temptation in a way that would cause harm would be the issue from my perspective.",canipayinpuns

Wyatt‚Äôs dad was a white lighter and it was a forbidden thing for witches and white lighters to be together for various reasons, but they were cleared. When she got pregnant and they had a dangerous situation where she tried to blow something up, bubbles appeared instead, or something fun and cute.

Imagine your partner got cancer and it was guaranteed that they were going to die, but it was fully, 100% curable and they refused to go through treatment. Wouldn‚Äôt you be pissed? I would.

He's been a vampire for a century, and Carlisle has been one for like...4 centuries. The way Edward thinks is different than Carlisle, and since vampires cannot evolve mentally, Edward's sadly not gonna break out of his pattern of thinking. Also, Edward hated what he was for the longest time, and him getting Bella pregnant and seeing that something he helped create was destroying her probably only made him feel more monstrous. He didn't know it was possible, neither did Carlisle or anyone else. They were all navigating it together, and Edward most likely didn't even know how to handle it. I mean, he is forever 17 after all. He's basically acting the same adolescent way. I wish he would've acted better about it too, and it made me sad when he was all like, ""Because you've GIVEN ME NO CHOICE! Bella, we're supposed to be partners, remember? But you've decided this on your own. You've decided to leave me.""  That's gotta be the most gaslighting, toxic af thing that the writers have ever made Edward say, and I wish they would've changed that. That's my least favorite line of his in the entire saga. Idk how it went down in the book, but the MOVIE? How they made him so narcissistic like that, and he didn't even listen to Bella? JEEZ. That made me mad.

Always check Stephenie Meyer, on social media, reddit page, or usually just her business website that is used as a way to connect to fans. It's on her Fickle Fish section of the site. 

Midnight Sun is going to be released in 2025/2026 as a cartoon on Netflix; Fickle Fish company is going to be the producers and it's her own business. This was hinted at throughout the promotion of the book itself, so I think, Netflix snagged the copyright for the media rights (in 2020). We don't know anything about the characters themselves, and how the characters are designed.

 Obviously as the book is from a different pov, we might see more of the Cullens and how they are seen from Edwards and the backstory of the plot before twilight itself. I hope this means there will be more series in Edwards pov.",Miserable_Block_2589

I think the costume/makeup department eased up on caking the light colored makeup that gave them the chalky look and overly done lips. You can only do so much for the contacts because every person is different with how they react or handle it (I know in Harry Potter they tried to give Harry green contacts to reflect his book counterpart but decided to veto them because they made Daniels' eye's hurt. They decided to prioritize his comfort over accuracy which I'm happy for) or how their natural color mixes with the yellow color.),Lovely_One0325

19e1c01,Wtf Breaking Dawn Part 2,kjalnih,2024-01-24 02:40:14,Read the excerpt from the book at least for #7 because it‚Äôs explained so much better. Instead of a shield think of her powers like a bubble or force field. The field blocks whatever is outside of it. Bella can expand the bubble to include Edward inside of the bubble. Since he is inside he is no longer being blocked by the bubble and therefore she no longer has anything blocking Edward from her thoughts. If you‚Äôve seen incredibles think of when Violet creates a bubble and Dash runs inside of it. Everything else is blocked out but it‚Äôs now created a unique pocket of space inside.,Potatosmom94

19e1c01,Wtf Breaking Dawn Part 2,kjo1rnn,2024-01-26 15:25:55,"Heads up, this my comment has a lot of book spoilers.




1. Bella doesn't choose whether or not to see Charlie again. In the books it goes more into it, but she couldn't handle giving him up and so Edward let her keep talking to him to placate her while pregnant. She made plans during this time to spend a year away so her eyes would change. Then she would allow her dad to come to his own conclusion which would be most likely incorrect. Jacob forced it.

2. Bella in the movies doesnt look much different, but bella in the book looks drastically different. She hardly recognizes herself and is genuinely scared. When charlie sees her he isnt sure its her and is scared as well. 

2.5 The reason she is so calm is because Bella has abnormal self control. In the books jasper is constantly upset because he doesn't understand it. They go into this more in the book, and Carlisle muses that her preparation beforehand made a big impact. This is one of her abilities, self control. She skips her newborn stage which is why she is able to withstand the temptation.

3. Charlie does get suspicious of it, but in the books he specifically states that he doesn't want to know anything. He'd rather ignore everything and have her in his life. He knows things are weird but chooses to start thinking about it, because he loves his daughter. He is a bit miffed she didn't warn him though and that she didn't let him know that she was getting involved in something.

5. Edward and Bella were a 1 time occurrence and hadn't ever happened before. The only cases of vampire hybrids didn't have the mother survive and are so rare because resisting human blood is nearly impossible for most vampires. The only known cases of vampire hybrids were from South America made by Joham who fathered Nahuel and a few daughters. He wants to create a super race of hybrids and is now on the radar of the Volturi.

5.5. SMeyer explains that while female vampires can't get pregnant because it requires a bodily change, male vampires can still father children because  their ""sperm"" is actually venom that carries their genetic data.

7. In the books, Bella works really hard to learn how her shield works and learns how to remove her shield. While it seems lame in the movie, they didn't show how much effort she put into learning how it worked. The reason the memories seemed choreographed is because she had planned ahead what memories to bring up because she didn't know how long she could keep her shield down. 

7.5 I believe the reason they showed her in the memories was just for the audiences sake. In reality it would have been POV.",ghostlyhero3

The CGI thing is really upsetting to me too. It kinda ruins the movies for me tbh, I feel like I would have loved for Renesme to have a more developed character- we watched this couple fall in love, get married, now I wanna see what their kid is like. But with her being mostly CGI that‚Äôs not really an option because they can‚Äôt make her talk and interact more without the CGI being more painfully obvious than it already was. It‚Äôs like they spent millions on this series but couldn‚Äôt find a better way to get an accurate Renesme.",Pinkp3ony
19e1c01,Wtf Breaking Dawn Part 2,kjhwobw,2024-01-25 13:02:30,"BD2 ends perfectly.. allowing Edward to see into her mind was powerful.. after the whole saga etc he finally gets that privilege which she can revoke ..

The last line of the book is pure gold.. they'll be together in love forever... love is eternal. the 1000 Years song is perfect..a real tearjerker

They did Charlie dirty, but if you watch closely, she promises to be in his life from then on, and so he will not be excluded.. how they'll deal with the growing child is not explained...

I like the Renesme child character and she's beautiful in the film.. but the CGI baby is inexplicable...I just watched the remake of Carrie, and they used a real young infant.

Edward and Bella fight beautifully...love how he swings her around and she side kicks Aro and then takes him out eventually.

Kstew is beautiful in both BD movies.. her face is darn near perfect imo..

Both movies lack the beautiful realistic moodiness of the first film, but...I can live with it.",DrGuitar72
19e1c01,Wtf Breaking Dawn Part 2,kozkcep,2024-02-05 05:23:43,"Yeah the last scene in the movie was just stupid to me. It was sloppy but fitting for the era it was shot in and designed for (2011-12?) how is Bella showing her memories of her life in third person? As if she‚Äôs not the one remembering it? She‚Äôs showing Edward milestones and moments from throughout her life from infancy to present day and it looks like the directors and editors were tired and wanted to rap it up with some fluff. It didn‚Äôt necessarily make sense and they could‚Äôve done better.¬†

Most of your points just solidifies the many blatant mistakes that SM made in this last book/movie. Bella should‚Äôve never been able to get pregnant. It was completely out of left field and felt like she had an agenda. Bella expressed that kids gross her out (superficially the snot, sticky fingers, germs, etc. and we never got beyond that reasoning) and she was more than willing to give up that opportunity to be with Edward forever. SM just wanted to make Bella have her cake and eat it too. She was ‚Äúselflessly‚Äù willing to sacrifice these things for Edward so in return she gets rewarded and showered(pick-me behavior, Peggy sue syndrome). And can be around her baby because it doesn‚Äôt smell too much like a human, and the most self-sufficient baby that doesn‚Äôt need much work or maintenance. (The pregnancy storyline honestly felt like a slap in the face for all of the other female vampires and Leah who were dealt unfair cards, and had to come to terms with their infertility) ¬†

Another cop out was Bella‚Äôs self control, people swear up and down that Bella had time to prepare for vampirism while others didn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs simply not the case. Again SM wanted Bella to have her cake and eat it too. Bella didn‚Äôt know what to do about her father. There wasn‚Äôt a clear plan yet and the cullens dropped the ball on this one by dragging out the story of Bella being sick and letting her still communicate with Charlie. The entire series also takes place in less than 2 full years. In those 2 years, Edward and the cullens also abandoned her for almost 7 months and she had no clue if they would come back to forks. If anyone wants to look up the timeline for the series it‚Äôs here on Reddit as well as other places. IMO that is not enough time to prepare yourself for a life-changing decision like this; genetically altering your DNA into a predator.¬†",
19e1c01,Wtf Breaking Dawn Part 2,lpx18fy,2024-10-02 02:34:35,Okay I just finished rereading the twilight books and watching the movies right after I finished them. They changed so much stuff.

19e1c01,Wtf Breaking Dawn Part 2,kjxdgpt,2024-01-28 08:20:48,"You hit many of my own feelings as well. My opinion is Charlie has always known what the Cullens are. Just like he knows the boys ate shifters. His best friends were the tribe. He grew up with them and knew the stories. 

You can't be a cop, especially Chief and be dumb. In Washington state you actually have to have a Masters in Criminology. He's also went through detective training. I never understood why SM made every character other than the Cullens appear like idiots. Edward proves that you can have years of education and still have no common sense. Bella has absolutely none. 

As I've gotten older and read the books in my 30s the more the teen characters annoy me. The best characters were those that had life experience. 

Bella and Edward to me always came across as spoiled brats needing everything to be their way or they threw a temper tantrum. Nothing or no one else mattered; not family, or friends unless they got what they wanted. Example...Bella's turn me or else, running off in Phoenix, and all of her in New Moon.

t7j161,Why was bella eating chicken legs in breaking dawn part 1 if she‚Äôs a vegetarian???,hzizqwh,2022-03-06 02:20:40,"I always thought of Bella as a vegetarian. Anything she makes/orders for herself is usually vegetarian-based.

Yes, in the books you hear about her making fish etc., but it‚Äôs usually only in the context of cooking‚Äîshe‚Äôs cooking meat, but always when making meals that include Charlie‚ÄîI can‚Äôt ever remember if she eats it, too, except for spaghetti.

In my household, I have myself‚Äîam lactose and gluten sensitive. Another who is lactose, beef, and soy sensitive. And a third who is lactose sensitive.

I cook a lot‚Äîand what they like to eat, I cannot, but it doesn‚Äôt stop me from cooking for them. I make additions or concessions to work around our varying food issues so I always thought of it as Bella just being Bella and taking care of Charlie, who is emphatically *not* a vegetarian.

It‚Äôs been quite a few years since I‚Äôve read the books though, so I very well may be wrong. Might have to do another read-through.

But even if they did, Jacob said Sam wouldn‚Äôt attack outnumbered which is why they wait until Carlisle, Esme and Emmett leave and Bella has given birth/is dead. They assume Jacob and Edward are incapacitated and the numbers go from 7 vs 10 to 7 v maybe 5 (in their minds - reality is different). I doubt Sam would attack when it‚Äôs 7 vs 9 and I doubt Sam would put a ‚Äúkill on sight‚Äù order on Leah or Seth. So Leah/Seth could go some grub for the Cullens.

However if feeding puts them in a frenzy, Bella would def be in danger. So that could be it.",watson0707

2. breaking dawn pt 1, idk why, i just like it haha. the wedding, the island, and the pregnancy is just so‚Ä¶ different from everything else. 

3. twilight, it‚Äôs a classic ofc! i think it used to be my comfort movie/book, but new moon took that spot on my most recent reread and watch. the blue filter is just iconic. 

4. breaking dawn pt 2, bella as a vampire is just ü§åüèº‚ú®. the cgi Renaissance creeps me out but i love the suspense, reading the books i actually felt nervous and anxious for the Cullens on their way to meet the Volturi. 

5. eclipse, EEK, okay, i think the book is good but the movie‚Ä¶ the wigs and the sideburns *gag*, the sideburns haunt me. 

now its time to rewatch the movies lmao",edwardsflu
wml2oj,How would you rank the movies?,ik1doev,2022-08-12 19:52:24,"1) Twilight - nostalgia biased? Maybe. But this movie has *style*, And while perhaps the other films tell stories that are bigger, they don‚Äôt necessarily do it better than the OG

2. Breaking Dawn Part 2 - Whole movie is a lesson in how to pace a film. Even the main score here oozes buildup. Unpopular opinion: I actually like the battle and sometimes wish it had actually gone down. Would it suck to lose three of my top five favorite characters, yes, but I‚Äôd trade them for closure and gravity. All that said, this is a great film with good writing and the one I turn to the second most.

3. Eclipse - my wife hates this one, but it‚Äôs a solid movie if you ask me. I think the issue is that it does take too much focus from Bella, who is more or less relegated to damsel in distress and not an active protagonist. But if you look past that, it‚Äôs a fun movie with good action and lots of excitement. Plus, who wasn‚Äôt ready to kiss Victoria goodbye?

4. New Moon - New Moon is a little uneven in pacing. We have the whole quasi rebound with Jacob arc, which is abruptly shifted to saving Edward. This is fine for the overarching story, but really seems to forget about the first three fourths in the final one. Still a good movie and all, though.

5. Breaking Dawn Part 1 - This ranking isn‚Äôt exactly a demerit of the movie. I just find this movie highly uncomfortable and I usually skip it over. I have a thing about weird pregnancy in fiction that shakes me to my core (despite being a guy), and I just can‚Äôt watch anything with that plot, which is a shame because it IS good and I also genuinely love everything else in the movie, especially the Jacob/Sam conflict.",AlyxxStarr

wml2oj,How would you rank the movies?,ik1wu9t,2022-08-12 22:01:45,"Twilight: OG + Catherine Hardwick. No further explanation

New Moon: It's a cozy, fun, fall weather movie. You get to see more personality / small talk out of Bella. Plus, this is the last movie all of the characters have decent looking hair & makeup. Even though I'm Team Edward, this ones just got some good elements for me.

BD1: Good mix of getting to see some character personality and a mix of conflict / drama. Plus... you know, the honeymoon scenes

Eclipse: worst hair, plot line is very much feeling like a forced bridge between New Moon & BD. So much could have been better from hair, makeup, dialogue, plot points. Actions dont have consequences. But still, not the worst.

BD2: I love certain scenes but mostly don't like Renesme, don't like the renesme / Jacob plot or how much screen time the wolves got. We waited 3 books/4 movies to find out what Cullen family life / vampire life is like and we got an overload of the wolves. Felt very backdoor pilotish.

wml2oj,How would you rank the movies?,ik3x9vg,2022-08-13 09:14:26,"# 1. Twilight

**Likes:**

* I love the vibe, the blue filter and all the feels. 
* Lots of great scenes like the biology class scene, the forest (""I know what you are""), meeting his family, Port Angeles, Vampire Baseball, James attack + the vampire bonfire party, the prom.
* Lots of good quotes: ""How you likin' the rain girl"", ""My monkey man"", ""Hold on tight spider monkey"", ""And so the lion fell in love with the lamb.""
* The soundtrack!

**Dislikes:** 

* Scenes that were missing from the book like the bloodtyping scene.
* Not enough Bella/Edward happy times.

# 2. New Moon

I'm going back and forth between New Moon and Eclipse for 2nd place. Right now it's New Moon.

**Likes:** 

* The soundtrack is epic.
* Jacob and Bella's developing friendship.
* Jacob's phasing.
* Victoria being chased by the wolves through the forest with ""Hearing Damage"" playing is just a work of art!
* Reunion with Alice.
* The Volterra Scenes + the reunion with Edward.

**Dislikes:** 

* Depressing for a big part (but well done in terms of acting and ambience). Sometimes it's really painful to watch this part.
* I am frustrated with how Bella took Edward back so easily at the end. She really should have left him dangling outside her window for a few weeks. 
* The hair/makeup department obviously hated Jasper/Jackson.
* The adaptation from book to movie resulted into a lot of the good stuff being cut: Alice' return and her conversation with Charlie, the flight to and from Volterra, the return at the airport etc.

# 3. Eclipse

**Likes:**

* More Cullen scenes.
* Jasper and Rosalie's background stories.
* More wolf pack.
* The proposal.
* The tent scene.
* The soundtrack.

**Dislikes:**

* Book/movie adaptation: more good scenes were altered or completely left out. 
* Emmett's Romulan hairstyle.
* Edward's wig and side burns.
* Bella's mop.
* Replacing Rachel Lefevre with Bryce Dallas Howard! 
* Jacob manipulating Bella into kissing him by threatening with suicide.

# 4. BD 1

**Likes:**

* The wedding and the honeymoon were great, but I would have liked more scenes from the honeymoon and their time as a married couple.

**Dislikes:**

* Different vibe from the other movies.
* The soundtrack started to get more cheesy. 
* The pregnancy.

# 5. BD 2

**Likes:** 

* Bella's transformation.
* The love scenes in the cottage.
* The happy ending.

**Dislikes:**

* Not enough happy times, like seeing Bella adjust to her new life and spending time with her family. 
* BD 2 just felt alien to me compared to the other movies.",ACDaizy

BD 2: I like the fight scene & I like that Charlie got to a happy place. Love the Jacob wolf reveal & grandpa Charlie coping with the weirdness ""You've grown half a foot; seriously 6 inches."" More relaxed Edward. 

Could go either way New Moon & BD1. I love the very brief normalcy & not depressing Edward (in the extended versions) just before she gets sick.  But New Moon has an awesome soundtrack & mood.

Eclipse: least favorite book & movie. Everyone is awful & stupid at some point. The bedroom/ proposal scene is the only one I really look forward to in this movie.

wml2oj,How would you rank the movies?,ik3imw3,2022-08-13 06:02:33,"From a standpoint of how entertained I personally am while watching the movies, I‚Äôll say:

1)Twilight - Great indie movie vibe. The effects, while corny, work for the action scenes imo. I actually think the lack of CGI and use of practical effects is both charming and beneficial to the down-to-earth vibe. I also love how localized the drama feels to Forks. This is before we learn about the Volturi and realize how complicated the vampire world is‚Äîand it just feels like a small town romance that just so happens to include the supernatural‚Äîit feels like a teen love story above all else. Plot wise, my only gripe is how Edward and Bella seem to suddenly fall into a relationship once she reveals that she knows he‚Äôs a vampire, when before their interest in one another seemed purely out of curiosity‚Äîbut that‚Äôs more of a story flaw than anything else. 

2)Eclipse - More than anything, I love this film and addition within the series because it really feels like the only book/movie where we as an audience are sure that Edward and Bella are solid together. There‚Äôs no wishy-washy *will they, won‚Äôt they* because Edward finally gets his shit together and is gonna stay with Bella for good. Yeah, SM tried to make it seem like Jacob had a chance, but we all know he didn‚Äôt. We also get so much more screen time with the other Cullens, awesome fight scenes at the end, and tons of cute Edward/Bella interactions. Admittedly, I know people might think this one is boring, because the pacing can feel a bit slow, but I actually think it adds to the localized feeling of this specific conflict‚Äîlike this is just something they have to deal with in their town, taking it day-by-day.

3) New Moon - IMO, this is the BEST overall film in the series, story-wise and structure-wise. The cinematography is beautiful, every shot feels purposeful, the soundtrack hits, and Bella and Jacob have great chemistry in this‚Äîand tbh it‚Äôs nice getting to see Bella have more of a vibrant personality brought out by Jacob. With Edward, she tends to soak up his energy and acts a lot more stoic and serious, and I think it would be nice to see them be more playful like Bella and Jacob are. We also get the wolves! And we get to see a lot of personalities within the group, and it‚Äôs a fun juxtaposition compared to how, frankly, boring the Cullens can be. I think I just don‚Äôt like watching it as much because there‚Äôs a lack of Edward in it.

4) BDP1 - I‚Äôll say that I LOVE the first third of this movie, because how could I not enjoy the payoff of 3 movies leading up to a fairytale wedding and a fun and playful honeymoon?? But dear god, the rest of the movie fucking DRAGS. As a concept, it‚Äôs a cool idea, and I think it would actually be a good movie if not in the twilight series‚Äîa body horror movie about a woman carrying a rapidly growing vamp baby. But the idea of it makes the tone of the movie feel so odd. The topic of pregnancy feels like a subject that twilight should‚Äôve never touched, because I feel like it was fumbled. I will admit, I really like how we get to see Edward actually giving a variety emotions, like anger and anxiety and frustration and sadness, compared to how one-note he usually is. UGH AND THEN THE IMPRINTING. Also, I really dislike having Jacob in this as much as he is, ending aside. I feel like after Eclipse, they should‚Äôve strayed away from Jacob, and maybe only have included him here and there.

5) BDP2 - I hate this movie so much. The CGI is actual dog shit, the lines and character interactions feel very weird and stunted. I feel like there‚Äôs a disconnect between Bella and Edward and their literal child, but it also felt that way in the books too, because again‚Äîa pregnancy storyline in Twilight should‚Äôve never happened. Bella just doesn‚Äôt feel motherly, no matter how much they try to convince you that she loves Rigatoni. The inclusion of Jacob just pisses me off lol, because they want to make it seem like now that Jacob doesn‚Äôt feel attraction towards Bella anymore, they‚Äôre all just the best of friends, but he feels really unnecessary at this point in the series. We do get the big fight at the end, which I‚Äôm not even mad about being a fake out. But it all feels so clunky and poorly done. The pacing absolutely drags until the very end; and then the ending feels non-impactful.",

New moon - still beautiful, love how in contrast to twilight it has a warmer color palette which makes sense cause it focuses more on the wolves. the scene where bella jumps off a cliff and sees Edward in the water is perfection. 

Breaking dawn part 2 - epic ending! remove cgi resentment, and it‚Äôs perfect. 

Eclipse - used to be one of my favorites when they first came out. i totally agree the movie downplays Jacob‚Äôs toxic behavior, and does Edward dirty. 

Breaking dawn part 1 - although i adore the first half. i have a phobia of pregnancy, so the rest of the film is traumatic to watch for me. 

we can all agree the whole soundtrack is INCREDIBLE!

wml2oj,How would you rank the movies?,kbeg84s,2023-11-30 13:35:26,"Possibly unpopular opinion: 
I truly think, as a fellow twilight fanatic (I downplay it to anyone I‚Äôve ever known ‚Äòcause no one else I‚Äôve been friends with has been a fan üòì) I think it‚Äôs important, especially as someone who is now (by internet standards) ‚Äúold‚Äù at 29‚Ä¶ everyone who was an OG fan of the books, or even just a fan of the movies, should re-watch them recently in order to accurately rate them. 

I‚Äôm not saying this with any malice or shade, just speaking from personal experience. As someone who has been re-watching them recently, and has done so every 2-3 years, I understand and appreciate so much more from the movies than I did when they came out. Maybe it‚Äôs just me? But it has now been officially 15 YEARS since the first movie came out! (I just googled it, holy s*it!!!) Anyway, I remember being a little mini when the first film was announced and losing my mind with excitement. ü´£

My older sister (who is very much a book-loving, classic novel reading, skeptical and picky human) introduced me to the series when the first book came out‚Ä¶ without telling me the plot, or anything about it. 

She agreed to lend me the first book on the promise that I‚Äôd skip reading/learning anything about it prior to reading the first 5-10 chapters, not learn anything else about it without talking to her first. I had NO IDEA Edward was a vampire when I first read it (thank you, my amazing sister!) and so I got to have all of the mystery, anticipation and excitement of reading it as a blissfully ignorant future fan. 

Speaking strictly about the movies here, in the times I‚Äôve re-watched them, my favourite is based on the feeling I get from the movies vs the books. My favourite *part* of the movies will always be in Breaking Dawn Part 1, the wedding and honeymoon scenes, especially where Edward and Bella go to Rio then Isle Esmee, although I wish they‚Äôd extended and added MUCH more detail to the time period of the characters. 

Best feelings/vibes, which remind me of how I felt when reading the books for the first time, based on movies/scenes from the movies which influenced my choices:

1) Breaking Dawn part 1- Wedding/Honeymoon scenes. Also, Alice and Jasper being so badass with their pre-planning. I also wish they‚Äôd extended the scenes in the movies where Alice/Jasper planned the entire thing‚Ä¶ so beautifully thought out and mysterious. But the movies would be 4-6 hours each if they were to *really* do the books justice‚Ä¶ Plus, it was SO EXCITING when I read the book and Bella became a vampire, since so many of us fans were waiting with baited breath for her to do so. Although the movie cuts off right after it happens, when I watched it in theatres, I was beyond excited waiting for the next movie to come out. 

2) (maybe..?) Twilight, First Film- Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I also have a love/hate relationship with the way it was done. On the one hand, it did give the *vibe* that *I* felt from the first twilight book‚Ä¶ ish. On the other hand, it did seem like it was a low budget film as far as the directing/writing/actoring chemistry went. More like an indie movie than a multi million dollar beginning of a movie franchise that it had yet to become. The colour filters, as far as *mood* goes, did help the vibe, kind of‚Ä¶ On the other hand, the slow-mo, filters, directing, on screen chemistry left a lot lacking. 

3) New Moon - This is number 3 for sadness/depression reasons, not because it wasn‚Äôt good. I tend to avoid this one (or a lot of it) when re-watching the series, for personal reasons. Depression is no joke, so although it was very well done and IMO pretty damn close to the book, out of all of them, it is just too difficult for me to watch a lot of it, so again, this ranking is my *feeling* about the series, rather than a critique on acting/directing/writing/how close it is to the books. As someone who has gone through such intense trauma/depression to understand and relate to the scene in which Bella becomes a numb zombie for several months‚Ä¶ this part, and most of the movie was SO DAMN ACCURATE!  But it still hits a bit close to home. So it is kind of a tie for 3rd/4th. 

4) Eclipse - The budget got bigger for this one, the chemistry for the actors was at a pretty good point, so it made the characters more believable, the story was accurately portrayed. Most of all, I‚Äôd gotten enough time to acclimate to the actors being the characters, so I believed them more, and felt more and more immersed in the story. All of the movies seemed too short, from what I remember of the books, but this one felt very accurate, just too short considering the beautifully detailed backstories of the other characters like Rosalie, Jasper, Alice, Carlisle, Esmee, etc‚Ä¶ but apart from this one seemingly *extra* cut short, it did make me feel, when watching, like I was immersed in the books again.

5) Party because it was split into 2 movies‚Ä¶ Although the budget got higher and higher, the actors had better and better chemistry (familiarity between the actors for so long helped a lot) it felt very rushed at the same time as made for making $ rather than staying true to the books. I know, I KNOW, it‚Äôs the typical crazy fanatic (like myself) argument that the books are *so much better* but it missed so many neat details, like a proper and accurate portrayal of the intricate and brilliant planning on Alice/Jasper‚Äôs part. Also the CGI BABY! Oh my lord, what were they thinking?! I get it, it was decent-ish for the time‚Ä¶ but really. Ugh. Also, the vibe was ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make some money off this cash cow franchise‚Äù rather than ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make a really great film‚Äù. There was so much neat detail in there! Like the reveal of how/where/why they learned about half human/half vampire babies, many of the intricacies of the Volturie‚Äôs involvement (along with the same issue in the other movies) and the way that Alice, Esmee, Carlisle, and even the rest of the Cullen family put every detail into making their home absolutely PERFECT for them. There was just‚Ä¶ so much missed that could have been. 

It almost would have been better to drag it out into another movie than to just simply split Breaking Dawn into 2 parts. 

Ok! Thanks for listening. I‚Äôm new to Reddit and VERY starved of communication with other Twilight fans, as well as being a tiny bit rusty on the finer details of the books, as I haven‚Äôt had the funds/ability/social confidence to buy/read them again when I haven‚Äôt had any friends/family who like them as well. My sister, who introduced me to the book series when it first came out, also became a traitor when the movies came out and the ‚ÄúI *HATE* the cheesy stupid Twilight books/movies‚Äù bandwagon began. 

Thank you all for (hopefully) not downvoting because I was so long-winded and ranted a bit. Also, if you love Twilight as much as I do, let‚Äôs be occasional-long-distance-casual-non committed-Twilight-bonded friends! Lord knows I need at least one ü´£",DelusionalGinger

Everyone should have their tongue suctioned to the roof of their mouth 24/7 (unless you‚Äôre talking/eating obviously) to keep your airway open and functioning at 100%. Unfortunately ‚Äúmewing‚Äù wont give you a sharper jawline as an adult, but it IS important for children to have proper tongue posture because that suction is what encourages the jaws to grow wide and forward. When you see kids needing things like palate expanders and lots of ortho work, that‚Äôs indicative of low tongue posture. If you CANT achieve tongue suction, you likely have a narrow palate and/or a tongue tie.

 For some weird af reason SM decided to make Edward think that Bella was just having baby fever and just wanted A baby, no matter from whom.

you know that's kind of a good point, like you'd think even those he has the frozen mental development of a I guess mature or advanced teenager, it kind of shows he's super bad at being a people reader or like just working on empathy or understanding of others.

And I guess if we follow that thought, maybe it shows how his powers have actually crippled him in a way. Being able to read someone's thoughts, you never really have to guess or fully be aware of body language for example.

The problem wasn‚Äôt that she chose to continue the pregnancy, but that nearly everyone was trying to dictate that choice for her, whether it was Edward pushing abortion or Rosalie aggressively protecting the fetus at all costs. The lack of agency Bella had in making a fully informed, pressure-free decision is what makes the whole storyline frustrating.

Edward‚Äôs reaction was definitely uncomfortable‚Äîhis anger and desperation were understandable to a point (since Bella was literally dying), but the way he lashed out at her instead of processing his own feelings differently was toxic. 

At the end of the day, Bella chose to keep the pregnancy, and that should‚Äôve been the final say.

So tempting. 

I didn‚Äôt want to consider, didn‚Äôt want to imagine, but the images came anyway. I‚Äôd fantasized about Bella that way too many times, back when there was still a possibility of us, and then long after it was clear that the fantasies would only leave festering sores because there was no possibility, none at all. I hadn‚Äôt been able to help myself then. I couldn‚Äôt stop myself now. Bella in my arms, Bella sighing my name¬†.¬†.¬†. 

Worse still, this new image I‚Äôd never had before, one that by all rights shouldn‚Äôt have existed for me. Not yet.

Bella, healthy and glowing, so different than now, but something the same: her body, not distorted, changed in a more natural way. Round with my child. 

I tried to escape the venomous weed in my mind. ‚ÄúMake Bella see sense? What universe do you live in?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAt least try.‚Äù 

I shook my head fast. He waited, ignoring the negative answer because he could hear the conflict in my thoughts.‚Äù



Just eww. I can‚Äôt. This scene lives in my head rent free because when I read it for the first time I forgot that the players in this scenario are a 100+ year old mindreading vampire, an almost 19 year old married woman, and a horny 16 and a half year old.

Edward was grasping at straws with that one and I‚Äôm sure he knew that. I also said at that point he was loosing it and Jacob also basically said the same thing. Jacob entertaining it is also in character for Jacob. I‚Äôm sooooooo not team Jacob, but I can acknowledge that Jacob was an immature boy who thought he was in love so he entertained the idea like an idiot. Edward sent Jacob in to make this offer to Bella, not to hold her down and make a baby. 

Also acknowledging that if my husband the father of my unborn child, turned to my long time emotional fallback and basically saying to him ‚Äúhey since my baby is killing her, maybe she she should have yours instead‚Äù would be literally significantly problematic given that we are both human and my human baby isn‚Äôt going to hurt anyone and my baby and myself can more than likely survive.

At the end of the day when a man loves a woman he‚Äôll do anythingggggg to save her, even if it makes him look crazy.

Part of the tragedy of Jacob‚Äôs story is that he wasnt allowed to be a normal 16 year old. This is a weird thing for an adult to ask of a 16 year old boy.

Also Jacob volunteered the pack to fight to protect Bella. He shouldn‚Äôt have because it wasn‚Äôt his place but he volunteered. He didn‚Äôt volunteer to become a sperm donor to them. He didn‚Äôt volunteer this idea and then when he said no immediately (because despite being 16 and horny for Bella he still was like: this is kind of gross and compares it to Bella being taken out like a movie at blockbuster) Edward still pushes it because he can see his teenage hormone brain battling his logic and reasoning.

The Cullens have boatloads of money, they could do any amount of IVF if Edward thinks Bella just wants motherhood. To propose a 16 year old boy who hasn‚Äôt had the time to get over his feelings for a now married woman (who admitted to loving him and wanting a life with him but still chose someone else) be the one to inseminate his wife because of their shared connection, is wayyyy too much. It‚Äôs heartlessly selfish at its best and manipulatively deplorable at its worst.

I understand Edward is emotionally stunted and worried about losing the love of his life. This whole scenario is still egregiously fucked up. When I read it when I was younger (12/13/14) I was like ‚Äúoh wow he really loves her‚Äù but from an older perspective it‚Äôs disgusting.

to your point, it kind of seemed to me that Meyer‚Äôs own opinion of women being ‚Äúmarried young and having a child thats a miracle‚Äù comes across stronger than her desire to do well by her own characters. and of course, Bella, who earlier in the book/series is pretty vocally child free falls in love with Radish (as is the experience some women have, this comment is not knocking that) when she realizes the possibility of it looking like Edward, with whom she is intensely infatuated. that to me reeks of the whole idea that it‚Äôs a womans job to not only submit body, mind, heart, and soul to their partner, but that its the most important thing that a woman can do is to give that partner a continuation of their genes. i think that even if Bella giving birth to Rapidash and having Jacob imprint on her was still the end goal of Twilight, it couldve been approached in a more horror/dark romance approach to the idea of a vampire/human hybrid being born to a human and causing their death. my personal two cents",pizzabagelprincess

The wedding kind of makes sense because for Edward's time (and the rest of the Cullens) it was very normal to marry young - getting married was the first step to setting up a life together, and sex before it was frowned upon. If you take the view that Bella is signing up for eternity with him, what's it to her if she gets married? Naive and foolish yes but there is a logic to it. Also part of her fitting in with the Cullen couples in general (again naive and foolish but you can see it).

The pregnancy is just like ... whyyy? But it's not warm and fuzzy by any means.. at least not until after and Bella comes through the other side. Then Jacob imprints and everyone forgets all the stress and trauma and skips off into endless bliss.

A lot of it is written from Jacob's pov by the way, so it's not endless Bella preggo obsessing - but obviously the pregnancy and it's consequences are pretty central. Rhubarb's existence saves the treaty (via imprinting) and draws in the Volturi, so prepping for that is a whole thing.",

If I could change Breaking Dawn, I'd have cut out Renesmee altogether and had the Volturi find some other way to pick a fight with the Cullens, and actually have a fight. Jacob could die in battle for a tragic ending, or fall in love with someone else, like Leah (don't love the pairing but it does make a certain amount of sense) or imprint on one of Bella's friends like Angela for a happier ending.

To make things even ""better"": Do you know the factual reason why we most likely feel that way?

Because, unlike New Moon and Eclipse, Breaking Dawn is not a natural, authentic sequel to the book that came before it.

It's a slightly re-written and re-titled sequel to Twilight, not to Eclipse.

Its original title used to be ""Forever Dawn"", and Meyer wrote it as a direct sequel to the first Twilight book. Everything except some of the wolf stuff was already in there: The wedding, the honeymoon, the pregnancy, the imprint, the vengeful snitch, the Volturi threat, the resolution through Nahuel.

The only thing Breaking Dawn really added was Eclipse-adjacent Jacob being frustrated at his world quite literally being retconned around him, and some of the tribe infighting.

It's really just a destructive, regressive, sloppily re-canonized AU of the second book, not a proper, constructive, trilogy-based fourth installment.

Respectfully disagree, the addition of New Moon and Eclipse helped ease into Breaking Dawn because imagine reading Twilight and then Breaking Dawn, it's way too fast so it's not fanservice, it's listening to construction criticism. Fanservice would be if fans were vocal about how they wanted Twilight to end and since people loved Jacob, she decided to have Bella end up with Jacob instead. *That* is fanservice, listening to your editors isn't.

>Her sloppily re-canonizing Forever Dawn after the new story had long outgrown it was self-indulgent.

Again, not self-indulgent. She didn't say ""I want Bella to have a pregnancy storyline because I want a pregnancy storyline"". She already had the idea of a baby idea stored away after doing research. It's about doing what feels natural to the story's route. Self-indulgent would of been Edward never leaving since she, too hated it, she tried to come up with any idea that would prevent it but none of them worked. He still left, in the end.",KC27150

I‚Äôm sure she had to make up a lot of stuff that was never meant to be a part of her original story.

There was a wonderful comment on a different post a few weeks ago about breaking dawn being a bit bland that I thought made perfect sense. Breaking dawn doesn‚Äôt really capture the magic or allure of being a vampire but is instead a story of Bella just becoming an adult woman. She gets to marry her high school sweetheart, have a baby, live with her family, and keep her childhood best friend. On top of that she has spectacular control over her thirst and powers despite being a newborn. None of it brings any tension or danger. The story just becomes ‚ÄúBella grows up and becomes an adult‚Äù",cloudsongs_
1gqup63,‚ÄúDoes anyone else feel like there‚Äôs a huge difference between Twilight and Breaking Dawn? ,lx1fpsx,2024-11-14 04:37:53,"I think there‚Äôs a few things going on. One is that the first book in a series often involves world building, and that can feel magical to readers. In Twilight‚Äôs case, the world building expanded a bit into the second book because of the werewolves, but definitely diminished in Eclipse. I enjoyed the extensive number of vampires in Breaking Dawn, but it was definitely less groundbreaking than the first book.

Another factor is that an author changes over time. Maybe they‚Äôre jaded, maybe they‚Äôre giving in to fan desires, maybe they‚Äôre overreacting to fan feedback, maybe they got a different editor, etc. It‚Äôs hard to do anything consistently over a decade or more. Everyone changes styles slightly and changes how they work or produce art.

A third factor I‚Äôd suggest is that serialized romance  always struggles. Book 1 they fall in love and he‚Äôs flawless, Book 2 they go through an unexpected trouble, and beyond that you‚Äôre repeating something.

But the way the story evolves is what makes it a great story to me. Twilight starts out with classic obsessive first-love and you don‚Äôt want to put it down. New Moon & Eclipse cover senior year when Bella does a lot of growing and learning about who she is outside of Edward.

A lot of YA series of the time suffer from this actually. 

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs because Stephanie Meyer wasn‚Äôt really a ‚Äútrained writer‚Äú. That‚Äôs not to say she‚Äôs not a ‚Äúgood writer‚Äù. Like obviously her stuff sold. But rather Twilight was her first book from my understanding. And many authors who are published have written maybe 10 books before they even publish. And in the writing world with those 10 unpublished products are practice, and honing your crafting skill as a writer. So in this way, she really is a unique unicorn and special within the writing world to have her first project picked up and published. On top of that, her first project basically doubles are even triple what normal debut first time authors are even allowed to have word count, wise. Like this isn‚Äôt to knock Stephanie Meyer, but there is some valid criticism that you probably could‚Äôve knocked twilight down maybe by a third or 1/4 and still have retained a really good story. 

So my guess is that because of this lack of experience and mastery of her skill, you can really see her struggling and fading. It‚Äôs hard to keep up that pace and keep everything straight. As the Twilight series wore on, I definitely know there are a lot of plot holes and questionable for decisions that were made. I think a really really good. One is her flipping between POV‚Äôs in Breaking Dawn and also her trying to oddly lay out some sort of crime or mystery feel to it. And I felt like she didn‚Äôt execute that well even though I don‚Äôt read crime or mystery. it was like a scatter shot right after you hit the ball to start a game of pool. She had a lot of ideas that she just threw in there which happening first draft but once you edit it, they come out and get smoothed . But I think this goes back to. She just didn‚Äôt have the time.

I think if she had more time between Books, because I think the books came out maybe less than a year apart, we would‚Äôve also seen much tighter and cleaner writing. Like if The Books came out in eight months for us, she probably only had maybe one month and a half to write each book and then another month to edit it once she got it back with notes. And arguably even trained professional writers who do this for a living and pump out mass market fiction that‚Äôs good and marketable struggle and have to really practice the skill. I think a year ago I remember listening to Alexa Done talking about that.

Again, not to knock Stephanie Meyer, but she openly says and admits. This was all born out of a dream. So my guess is that she probably didn‚Äôt develop a future for Bella and Edward outside of that happily ever after fade to black where they get to go to homecoming. And that‚Äôs a perfectly acceptable and happily ever after ending in any romance book whether it‚Äôs adult or young adult. So I think in this way Publishers and the commercial world really driving artistry and storytelling can resulting weaker less vibrant stories. Not always. But I think this might be a case where just did because as the creator and artist here Stephanie Meyer ,just didn‚Äôt have it planned out and she wasn‚Äôt supposed to IMO. She didn‚Äôt have to. It was a perfectly acceptable, paranormal and urban fiction. She used the reality and only changed very small aspects of it. And that‚Äôs good enough for a standalone book. Many adult romance paranormal series do this. Each book in that series is a standalone and that‚Äôs fine. Like a lot of writers can write standalone single books and still go onto to write other amazing stories. But I think being a debut author Stephanie Meyer also didn‚Äôt have the pole or industry to say back off and give me time. But then again, I don‚Äôt know how many big name authors even still get that respect.",BloodyWritingBunny

Bella is fascinated with Edward and the vampires initially in Twilight.

In BD, it's almost like a vampire soap opera. She's pregnant, nearly dies, has a vampire hybrid baby that no one has a clue about, and then the volturi come to kill her and then it never happens because Alice basically sorts it all out. It's great that Bella and Edward have got their happy ever after and that there's some light at the end of the tunnel for Jake too, but it is when everything gets very serious and they all become ""adults"" and just settle into family life.

So in that respect, I just see it as mirroring real life. Your first love is very exciting as a teenager, every day seems like an adventure.

Specifically about the conversation jacob and edward have in breaking dawn to me that speaks more to how out of his mind upset he was watching the life get sucked out of the person he‚Äôs dedicated his life to. normally that isn‚Äôt something he would consider but he‚Äôs out of his mind thinking bella is going to die and if there is just some way to make her happy and keep her alive he‚Äôd do anything. 

With jacob‚Äôs pov you are seeing inside his head, not all of the things he thinks are his actions. If someone were able to read my mind they‚Äôd be able to judge me for a lot of odd things I have thought about but don‚Äôt agree with and wouldn‚Äôt actually do but i think about. Like the eclipse when jasper briefly considers having bella in the clearing during the fight. edward says that to jacob and he thinks about it but i don‚Äôt think he would participate in that and shouldn‚Äôt be judged for thinking about it.

 I feel like a lot of the time the critiques about the characters behavior in twilight(and other paranormal stories) aren‚Äôt fair because people apply our world morality and expectation. i don‚Äôt think the things they do always acceptable but i do think they can‚Äôt be criticized the same way a human being in our world would be. The book was also written in the early 2000s when the standards were different and things shittier and that just is part of what you get when you ingest media older than 5 years",boneboiz

Also, I don‚Äôt know how either of them thought raising a human child, especially a human child with the wolf gene, around a bunch of vampires is a good idea. And if Bella just has a regular human child and becomes a vampire, she‚Äôd eventually have to watch her kid die.

Your experience is valid, but there was nothing titilating about that scene from my perspective. Yeah Jacob was being weird about it but that's Jacob for you. He's possessive and gross. It feels more uncomfortable than wish fulfillment. Same with basically every interaction he has with Bella in Eclipse. He's harassing and manipulating and assaulting her. It's not hot. I didn't feel like I wanted to be in Bella's shoes. 

(Though for that it's true that Stephenie thought it was romantic and didn't see the second kiss as an assault. Which is why Edward didn't react to it like it was. But like she's wrong. She did write it as an assault. And the way she wrote Bella ""realising"" she was in love, while she was scared and confused and hating herself, felt more like some kind of dissociation or breakdown than a moment of clarity.)

I do get where Edward was coming from in BD too. He wasn't objectifying Bella; he was just trying to think of a compromise she might go for. And if Bella did want to have a kid with Jacob while being married to Edward, and everyone involved was cool with that, great, more power to them.

1dkl68c,Does anyone LIKE Breaking Dawn?,l9q6bv7,2024-06-22 05:42:59,"I enjoy bits and pieces of breaking dawn. I loved being able to see Bella be a vampire and her new senses and learn how to use her gift. I also LOVED any speck of Volturi content. 

I have never liked the pregnancy/Renameme plot line because Bella didn‚Äôt want kids and that was ruined AND because Bella never had to live with the consequences of becoming a vampire like she wanted. For example she didn‚Äôt lose Jacob or Charlie, like becoming a vampire should have cost her. 

I think Renameme is a cool horror concept (instant adult trapped in a body playing catch up for 7 years with an unneeded & unrelenting want for human blood?? That‚Äôs a horror movie I would see.), but I don‚Äôt feel she fits well into the Twilight universe. I also hate the imprinting, I‚Äôve never liked how it was done but breaking dawn really drove that home. 

Jacob HATED Renameme but the second he imprints those feelings are GONE. He doesn‚Äôt get to work through them or anything, they‚Äôre just erased and suddenly he HAS to do anything and BE anything that makes the demon happy including letting her bite him during her tantrums. There‚Äôs even a part in the book where he‚Äôs horrified by something but compelled to clap for her since that‚Äôs the reaction she wants in that moment. 

Also, Renameme is born with a fully developed brain and all inherent knowledge that goes with it but has to wait 7 years for her body to catch up while Jacob is 16 whose shifting forced his body to age to and then freeze at fully developed. So, while both of their brains are fully developed Jacob is still only 16 since he, unlike his imprintee, doesn‚Äôt get an instant adult brain with knowledge, just the brain itself. 

Either way you look at it, creepy af AND while Renameme has all of the control in the relationship because she‚Äôs the imprintee and gets to pick what relationship she wants from the imprinter (brother, friend, protector, lover) since whatever the imprintee wants, the imprinter must provide why would she go out and find any other potential romantic partner when she has someone who literally can‚Äôt say no to anything she may want since their life‚Äôs purpose is to do and be anything their imprintee wants. 

The imprint as Smeyer wrote it is literally magical slavery that makes the slave happy to serve by erasing any resistance they had and that only happens to the native characters whose culture and name she‚Äôs stolen and misrepresented. It‚Äôs fucked. The vampire version of ‚Äúimprinting‚Äù is that once they feel strongly for someone their feelings never fade, so they get to choose who they‚Äôre attached to and they‚Äôre not compelled to do anything they don‚Äôt want to.",Lilith_Mornings

I don‚Äôt know why, but stalking him across the lawn and yelling about the nickname is one of my favorite scenes.

People seem to take issue with the fact that things are ""easy"" for Bella, but that's not my perspective at all.

There's an entire chapter dedicated to describing the absolute hell that Bella goes through while becoming a vampire, which always explained to me why she, similar to Carlisle who also burned in absolute silence, has an easier time with controlling her thirst because she practised insane self-control for the two days or so that she burned. After describing the torture she was going through as clinging to the burning stake rather than being tied to it, what could possibly be more difficult to control? It's not supernatural self-control, it's just something she unknowingly taught herself during her transformation to save Edward from torturing himself.",TerMornetor

Eclipse felt like the climactic installment. The vampires and the wolves unite to form an alliance (and almost become something resembling friends), you have the giant battle in an open field, and Edward finally rips off Victoria‚Äôs head, the final vampire of the nomadic clan itching to kill Bella. 

I see Victoria as the primary villain of the Twilight saga rather than the Volturi because she was the main plot force in New Moon and Eclipse. I‚Äôm glad we got Breaking Dawn for the slow boil lead-in to Edward and Bella‚Äôs marriage and her subsequent change into a vampire complete with a biological child and peace with the Quileutes, but it didn‚Äôt feel as high-stake as a massive army of Newborn vampires raised with the purpose of avenging the villain from the first book.

it would have been perfect if Jacob didn't imprint on an actual infant but i guess SM primed us for that when Quil imprinted on 3 year old Claire and Jacob explained it to Bella. I would much rather have seen Jacob with Leah in a sort of fuck wolf imprinting, let's go against it on purpose, kind of relationship. but then the problem would be what happens if either one of them DID find their true mate (but that would occur outside of the twilight series anyway since it ends with breaking dawn so not really an issue)

i know the imprinting was necessary for the wolves to not kill the Cullens but there hadddd to be another way üò≠ Sam was ready to just let Bella become a vampire and mind his business, they just got pressed about the unknown potentially immortal child. (side note, do the wolves even know what immortal children are? or have they only ever encountered adult vampires)

seems like when Bella was pregnant, the Cullens should have just moved away and never told Jacob or Charlie. Bella has to be dead to her mother Renee anyway, it just seems fair that Charlie gets the same treatment of her never seeing him again. although she put him through hell in her 18 months of living in Forks lol (and for 6 of them edward wasn't even there!)",piercethevelle

At one point Edward calls Emmett and Jasper ""Em and Jazz"", nicknames which have never been mentioned before and are completely out of character for all of them.

I am dragging myself through the book but it's just such a drop off in quality I'm convinced SM didn't even write it, and it must be ghost written or borrow heavily from fan fiction.

1dkl68c,Does anyone LIKE Breaking Dawn?,l9nbl7w,2024-06-21 17:52:58,"I sometimes skip BD on my rereads. There‚Äôs a lot of things I don‚Äôt like about it, and a lot that I do. 

Bella is such a plain and average girl ‚Äî so anyone can relate to her. But then she gets all horny and starts hopping on Edward whenever she can like okay, yeah, I do that with my SO too‚Ä¶ but *all* of her relatability flies out the window as soon as she finds out she‚Äôs pregnant. 

It‚Äôs an unfortunate trope in romance novels, which I also love, that at the end the woman ends up pregnant and they have their baby and their happily ever after. I‚Äôm a fencesitter who‚Äôs mostly leaning on the side of never having kids. But I hate the idea that authors force on the readers, that your relationship and your life isn‚Äôt *complete* until you have a baby. It‚Äôs one of my biggest pet peeves when I read any romance. 

Once Rhianna is in the picture, Bella‚Äôs entire world seems to revolve around her and around fucking Edward as soon as the sun goes down. Edward, who was the center of Bella‚Äôs universe, takes backstage. He stops being relevant to the story so abruptly, after 3 novels of him being THE story. Now he‚Äôs just in the sidelines to get Bella off at night and then stop existing during the day. I‚Äôd rather Meyers had killed him, if she were going to make Rainmaker Bella‚Äôs (and the other Cullens‚Äô! AND Jacob‚Äôs) entire life. It would be more interesting to see how Bella handles that grief while staying around for Edward‚Äôs kid, realizing it‚Äôs not healthy or sane to off yourself after your partner dies. 

i do like seeing Bella finally become a vampire. Her confidence blossoms, we get (this was before MS) to experience what being a vampire is like‚Ä¶ but I hate that it's so easy for her. She just wakes up overpowered and totally normal. You're telling me that the instincts of a newborn vampire are so powerful and scary that the Cullens have to isolate themselves from society for a handful of *years*, but for Bella it's fine after a week? 

Bella never really struggles for what she wants. I guess the awful, bone shattering pregnancy could be suffering? But even then, it's for all of a month or two and then she's a beautiful vampire with the self control of Carlisle *and* her shield power. 

Whenever I read BD I can't help but picture everything I would do differently as an author and it takes me out of the moment. The first time I read it, I put it down for weeks after I got to the part where she got pregnant. I wish that the fetus actually *was* a monster, that Bella was completely wrong and actually has a consequence for her stubborn and awful choices for once.

All of that said, I am a sucker for happy endings. I did like that Bella got her vampire goal, that the Volturi didn‚Äôt kill them all. That she gets to live practically forever with Edward like she always wanted.",RedeRules770

Renameme is a horror movie concept that‚Äôs cool outside of Twilight, and away from Jacob, but in Twilight she‚Äôs terrible. Did you know she‚Äôs born with a fully developed brain and all the inherent knowledge that comes with it? She‚Äôs basically an instant adult that‚Äôs just waiting for her body to catch up. Jacob is 16, and while he is also in possession of a fully developed brain, thanks to the rapid aging his shifting caused, he doesn‚Äôt have the developed knowledge to go with it. 

I 100% would have loved to have seen Jacob imprint on Leah, or maybe one of Bella‚Äôs friends like Jessica/Lauren/Angela rather than Renameme. Can you imagine how Bella would have reacted to that? Especially since Jacob would probably tell them about vampires too and then they could have drama about the Cullens being vampires or something.

I loved meeting other vampires. Garret (Garreth?) being one of my faves, and the Amazon vampires. I loved the Romanians and would REALLY LIKE a small novel about them in their prime and their downfall. 

I loved that Leah got to escape from Sam and start healing. (I wish she and Jacob got together, that would‚Äôve been perfect imo. A really great conflict ‚Äúwhy are you hanging around protecting the girl you *used* to love?‚Äù). I loved seeing more Seth, the cute little puppy that he is. 

I loved that she still got to keep in touch with Charlie, who didn‚Äôt deserve to lose his only child *again* and I loved that Bella basically got a permanent relief from Renee, who was NOT the greatest mother. And I loved that Charlie was finding love again with Sue after all those years. 

I did appreciate Jacob‚Äôs POV. Meyers is great at writing different perspectives in the same story, something I struggle with myself as an author.

Critical thinking can't outweigh a supernatural force like that. 

For example, Jacob detests imprinting and sees it as disgusting, unfair and immoral, until it overwrites his brain. 

Bella's autonomy is canonically compromised. 

>Well when he finds out that she is marrying the person she already told him she was choosing he threatens to go kill himself as an obvious guilt trip into Bella kissing him. 

Marrying Edward equals an untimely death. He, at the time, feels like he can't live without her, so why bother?

It's sick behavior, but literally everyone is sick and broken by that point. 

At least he almost got her to stay alive with it. 

But, just like with the thinking, natural emotions can't outweigh supernatural ones. 

>I‚Äôm sorry, but if you don‚Äôt think thats a red flag in a guy, well, I don‚Äôt think anything I could say would change your mind. Apologies if you took offense

Jacob doesn't need any flags by that point. He's a deeply broken young man, throwing out his morality to try to save his lover's life. 

It's all messy, it's all ugly, it all sucks, for all of them.

As we learn in Bree Tanner's novella,>!she absolutely cannot let any of the newborns survive the failed attack, as they have the ability to reveal to the Cullens that the Volturi were involved in Victoria's plan. It didn't matter what justifications Carlisle fed to Jane, she was never letting Bree walk out of that clearing alive.!<Maybe Aro would've let it play out instead, he seems to enjoy these experiments within reason

2. There is no real resistance to the Volturi putting down that order in Eclipse. The Cullens weren't going to sacrifice themselves en masse to protect Bree. By the end of the Breaking Dawn standoff, it is /extremely/ clear that The Volturi have lost a dramatic amount of their soft power over other vampires, and they just lost their most solid grievance. Picking at anything else would have been seen as scrambling for justification to attack the Cullens, who are standing in front of them with a defensive army of their own. And yeah, most of them don't have a loyalty to Charlie, but Bella absolutely would've stood between the Volturi and Charlie, which means Edward would have, which means the Cullens would have, and the second Carlisle enters the fray like 80% of the Cullen's allies enter on principal.

1jq28iv,Breaking dawn: Why did Volturi not gaf about Charlie?,ml451hm,2025-04-02 23:45:48,"Honestly I think Charlie would become an obvious target for the Volturi after the end of Breaking Dawn. It makes sense to me that after the big show of force didn't pan out, the next step for the Volturi would be to regroup and then begin a campaign of slowly picking off people close to the Cullens in a way that was subtle enough to slip past Alice's vision. Aro would have plenty of information about how to do this after reading everything in Alice's mind. No doubt she has spent countless hours mulling over how the holes in her vision work. The simplest way to do this would perhaps be for the Volturi to create their own hybrid assassin that she couldn't see coming at all. 

I just can't imagine the Volturi being like ""aw shucks well Charlie *technically* doesn't know the Cullens are vampires, our hands are tied."" They know that Charlie knows something is off about the Cullens, and I think that would be enough for them to claim that letting him know as much as he did still posed a risk to their species. 

If I were Aro, I would be extremely interested in going after Renee as well. He saw her gift in Edward's mind, so he knows she has great potential for talent as a vampire. Kidnapping and changing her would also be a way to retaliate against the Cullens for embarrassing them.",bluegirlrosee

I think Renata, Aro's shield, is from a similar situation. And she has a vampire ancestor, the human family knows that they have a powerful patron, but they don't know exactly who and what he is. He turned her because of a possible gift. It seems he turned someone else from the family. The Volturi know and took Renata as a fine or something like that. I don't remember well. Formally, this is on the border, not a violation.
It's strange to me that Aro didn't think to turn Renee, but on the other hand, who knows, maybe she will can ""imperio"" him after turn and he decided not to risk it. Or not to anger the Bella.¬†

1jq28iv,Breaking dawn: Why did Volturi not gaf about Charlie?,ml94h70,2025-04-03 19:31:23,"Charlie's is best left alive for leverage reasons. 

The other covens largely helped the Cullens because *no law was actually broken* regarding Renesme. Had the law been broken and she was actually an immortal child, I doubt they'd have had nearly as many allies in the final confrontation - even if they dislike the Volturi, the law exists for a very valid reason, and very few would take up arguing for an immortal child to exist. 

Charlie's best use, to the Volturi, is as the likeliest way to get the Cullens to actually break the law, which requires leaving him alive and human. The second he knows they're vampires, not just something vaguely supernatural like Jacob, the Volturi have the Cullens as law breakers. 

It becomes ""turn him or kill him"", and they aren't obliged to give Charlie the same leniency they did Bella, like waiting months for it to actually happen. They're completely justified within their own law to demand it happen then and there. Knowing the Cullens, that would be a huge problem for them, and the Volturi now have reasonable grounds to destroy them. 

Even covens who know what Aro is doing would be hesitant to get involved because it would be the *second time* the Cullens objectively broke vampire law. First Bella, now Charlie. There's no moral/reasonable leg to stand on at that point - the Cullens knew the consequences and did it anyway. 

Standing against the Volturi at that point would be akin to declaring open war against them. It's one thing to be a witness to prove a law wasn't broken, it's another to act as an ally when it is. The Cullens would have the wolves, but that's really it - and that's infinitely more manageable, as the Volturi massively outnumber their conjoined forces.",kalluhaluha

However, with the development of the final confrontation and the true extent of Bella's gift manifested, the Cullens have become a formidable force rivalling the Volturi's own guards, so they have to tread very carefully. 

I think Aro probably breathed a sigh of relief he was able to convince Caius to let it go and leave in peace, because if they caused further aggression with the Cullens, the resulting fight would cause as much damage to the Volturi as it does the Cullens (Edward said this at the end of Breaking Dawn book). Attacking or otherwise harming Charlie in any way would have been a declaration of war, and Aro probably doesn't want that now. He'll bide his time and find another solution to ""recruit"" Alice and Edward into the guards, but a show of force is out of the question.",loupham9247

In summary: Charlie marries Sue, therefore making him a tribes member. The Quileutes are allowed to know of vampires because of their legends and mutual supernatural status. Therefore, Charlie being a Quileute by marriage could arguably be permitted to know of the vampires within Volturi law.

I don‚Äôt think Aro was prepared at all for the challenge the Cullens presented. For the first time they were beaten, and a fist never had to be thrown.

Literally the only reason the Cullens survived the attack was because Alice's gift gave them the advance notice they needed to prepare for it. This is the only thing Aro would need to circumvent in order to get to the Cullens. And the perfect solution to that problem conveniently fell in his lap in the clearing in the form of the hybrids.

I know what Stephenie has said outside the books, but as far as what's actually written, it comes across much more like Jacob emotionally manipulated her until she accepted the version of reality he was pushing on her. 

She says over and over that she doesn't feel about him the way he feels about her, the way he wants her to feel, that she's not in love with him. She continually thinks of Jacob as a friend and someone she doesn't want to lose but not as someone she's romantically attracted to.

Throughout New Moon he flirts and pushes her boundaries and makes it clear he believes he'll wear her down eventually. Throughout Eclipse, he acts like she's hurting him by choosing Edward over him to get her to feel sympathetic and want to comfort him. And she does internalise it - she calls herself a monster for \*checks notes\* telling Jacob she still wants to be friends with him and compares what she's doing to torturing him. He also starts telling her that she's actually already in love with him and is just in denial. It might not be textbook gaslighting, but it's in the same chapter at least.

Eventually, after all that, and after he tells her he'll kill himself unless she can convince him that she wants to be more than friends, and after he lets his guard down while kissing her and she can sense how vulnerable he is (it's at this point that she says, ""my brain disconnected from my body""), and after the kiss kind of feels good and Bella can't conceive of a world in which kissing someone you're not in love with could still be physically enjoyable, Bella finally collapses under the weight of it all and comes to the conclusion that she's in love with Jacob. It doesn't seem to be based on anything other than that she doesn't want to stop kissing him and that she doesn't want to lose him, and it's mixed in with the thought that she ""more than deserved whatever pain this caused me. I hoped it was bad. I hoped I would really suffer."" She's really not in an emotionally stable place at that moment.

Bella refers to her feelings toward Jacob three days ago (while she was pregnant) as ""madness."" We didn't get her POV at the time, but here she admits that it felt irrational, something that called for an explanation. Obviously, it was not how she felt before the pregnancy. 

And Jacob is also referring to approximately three days ago when he said, ""That was her ... we had to be together, even then."" He means even when Roadster was just a fetus, a few days ago, not even before she existed, which wouldn't make sense.",20061901

1fqkvht,Breaking Dawn Jacob and Bella ,lp6rubl,2024-09-27 14:15:47,"The vampire-amnesia/brain damage is the in-universe explanation.

The real life one is even more frustrating:

Bella and Jacob have forgotten all of their experiences and character development from New Moon and Eclipse, and, most importantly, their intense romantic love for each other, because _Breaking Dawn_ was technically written **before** _New Moon_ and _Eclipse_, and those two installments never really happened in its continuity.

Yup. 

It used to be called _Forever Dawn_, and it was the original, direct sequel to Twilight, until Meyer's team convinced her to stick to the much more relatable human highschool setting for a couple of books longer. 

But just about everything was already there in _Forever Dawn_. The wedding, the honeymoon, the pregnancy, Jacob imprinting on the baby, a vengeful vampire snitching to the Volturi (who was originally Victoria, not Irina), the imminent war, the international vampire army, the trial, Alice and Nahuel saving the day...

As you can see, there is practically _no_ original, New Moon and/or Eclipse-based content in the book that was later re-canonized under the new title _Breaking Dawn_, save for Jacob's pre-imprinting POV. 

Which is strikingly noticeable if you know the meta context. 

Jake spends the better half of the book being absolutely _flabbergasted_ and heartbroken over everyone around him acting like complete strangers who had forgotten all about everything they went through.

""I felt like - like I don't know what. Like this wasn't real. Like I was in some Goth version of a bad sitcom.""

It's as funny as it's sad. The poor guy has his entire reality retconned and rewritten around him, and is forced to be consciously aware of it.

""I thought the whole point was that you wanted your vampire more than anything. And now you're just giving him up? That doesn't make any sense. Since when are you desperate to be a mom? If you wanted that so much, why did you marry a vampire?""

He's essentially a stand-in for all of us New Moon and Eclipse fans, who felt just as alienated and cheated. 

Not sure why Meyer did that. Out of guilty conscience? Self-irony? Or just because it's the only logical way anyone could possibly react to such contradictory existential meddling from a higher power? 

Anyway, he's the last bastion of those who remembered the last two books, until he himself is caught and replaced by his outdated, regressed, imprinted Forever Dawn version, and goes through a similar lobotomy as Bella. And Edward. And practically every other character in the book. 

But hey, New Moon and Eclipse were only arguably the two best installments of the series. That's something you can easily just erase for your rightfully shelved, weirdo ""happy ending,"" right? 

Does it show that I'm still bitter about this?

When I compare the entire rest of the series to a few chapters at the end of Eclipse, it seems pretty clear that Bella is in a worse epistemic position at the end of Eclipse. Jacob has been deliberately undermining her faith in her own perceptions and playing on her sympathies to make her feel responsible for his feelings. Then on top of that there's everything else she's worrying about with the newborns and Victoria, and then Jacob threatens to kill himself. And then there's the kiss. And Bella is confused and overwhelmed and she feels like she can't trust herself (just as Jacob intended). 

I don't think that's the sort of situation in which someone finds clarity about themself. I think it's the kind of situation where someone could be persuaded to believe, at least temporarily, something they previously knew to be untrue. 

Especially when you consider how she never believed that in New Moon, when she knew it would make things easier. She at least somewhat wanted to love Jacob that way because it would make him happy and it would mean getting to keep him forever.

In my case, the disconnect between the trilogy and Breaking Dawn immediately hit me _like a freight train_, to a point where I struggled to keep on reading, long before I ever found out why (It was mostly written before New Moon and Eclipse). 

It's genuinely fascinating to me that many people just straight up didn't notice anything at all.

No offense? And then you say something that could be taken offensively. 

Yes, most things stayed the same between Breaking Dawn and Forever Dawn. But the fact that you are expecting Bella's ""voice"" to remain unchanged is what makes the least sense to me. You act shocked that the circumstances in her life have matured her in any sort of way. Were you expecting her to continue sounding like a teenager? 

Don't forget that the following **life-altering** events happened **in the space of 1.5 years**

* Falls in love with an immortal vampire
* Nearly dies after getting attacked by another vampire
* Nearly dies after the brother of the vampire boyfriend tries to kill her (and subsequently falls into a depression when the vampire boyfriend tries to convince her he doesn't love her)
* Reconnects with childhood best friend and then nearly loses him when he becomes a werewolf
* Is nearly killed by another vampire as a ""favor"" to an enemy
* Travels to Italy to save vampire ""ex""-boyfriend only to nearly become lunch to a 3000+ yr-old vampire
* Is nearly killed *again* when a vengeful vampire creates an **entire army** just to kill her
* Marries the vampire boyfriend and subsequently finds out she's pregnant. A pregnancy which will likely kill her.

I honestly don't quite get the rest of your comment. 

Five of the points you listed are completely ignored by Breaking Dawn, in favor of just re-canonizing Forever Dawn, making Bella feel off-puttingly _underdeveloped_, _immature_ and _regressed_ in it. 

That's my entire point. 

I expected Bella to act like she had actually experienced the last two books, but she didn't. 

Because, the way the book was written, she actually hadn't.
