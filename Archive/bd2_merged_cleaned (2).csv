I Know What You Are is iconic. I can‚Äôt imagine the confrontation scene without that score. It adds so much tension to the scene.

Bella‚Äôs Lullaby is iconic. I feel like this one is self-explanatory. Spectacular. This one almost feels like the Saga‚Äôs theme song.

Burwell might actually be my least favourite of the three composers we had, but his ""Twilight"" one is probably the most iconic of the series. I'm biased though, since I feel that movie is, itself, the most iconic. I also think it is his best of the three and had the most personality, but that also may be tied to where the franchise was in 2008 vs 2012 (as in, it is often compared to an indie film vs the big-budget productions we got later on).

I know the context of the song from the iconic ""say it"" scene, and know that Bella has made up her mind about pursuing Edward and staying near him. But that track means something a little different to me than what goes on in that sequence.

To me, I Know What You Are is when the disillusionment darkly descends upon you. You see the sad reality of what someone else is (or worse, *who* someone else is) that you care for, perhaps even love. You know what you have to do after that. But you know it's gonna hurt. Not just you, but them. No matter how you cut it off, it's not going to be pretty and the sadness yet determination to free yourself from this person's power or influence drives you to escape them once and for all.

nktc55,An analysis of Carter Burwell's Twilight and Breaking Dawn scores,gzg5cod,2021-05-25 22:57:33,"Oh yeah, take your time, I'll for sure read it.

My opinion--well, I guess it's more of a gripe? Burwell made a new theme/motif for Jacob in ""BD1"" that I LOVED. The one from ""A Wolf Stands Up"" and ""You Kill Her, You Kill Me."" IMO, they are some of the stand-out tracks in the entire film. I was disappointed  it was only used in those two tracks/parts of the movie, but you'd think he could reuse/rework it for ""BD2"", as it was his own creation (i.e. he didn't reuse Jacob's theme from ""Eclipse,"" which I do love as well).

I guess it's because Jacob takes a backseat in the final movie, but I still think they could've used it to further emphasize the roll he did still play. Regardless of your opinion of Jacob/Renesmee, the studio/team decided to commit to them (Alice's vision at the end). I would've liked for the score to reflect that, like a variation of Renesmee's theme with Burwell's pseudo-Jacob theme from ""BD1"", to highlight their relationship.

I listen to tons of scores as well, but I'm no composer/musical theory student. I have no idea if Burwell tried to do this and they just didn't work together. Honestly, I think Renesmee's theme is just a little too understated for me and I would've appreciated some 'oomph' with the Jacob 'theme.'

Sorry for the the rant, but I am too invested in this lol. Again, I am far from an expert, but you seem like you have a lot of knowledge, so if you want to chime in when you have the time, that'd be really cool.",GeekSpreadTooThin
nktc55,An analysis of Carter Burwell's Twilight and Breaking Dawn scores,gzh688r,2021-05-26 04:21:35,"That's a really good point! I've heard both of those songs, but I never thought too deeply about them until you mentioned it. Now that I listen to them together, they are really beautiful pieces. I could definitely see this theme fitting into BD2 -- and like you said, it would've been awesome if they blended it with Renesmee's theme at some point. Can you imagine the emotion if it played when Bella puts Renesmee on Jacob's back to have them escape together? It's a shame Burwell didn't take that opportunity.

I know this isn't the Jacob theme that you love, but I somehow forgot to mention in the OP that my favorite song from BD1 uses the instruments that represent the wolf pack to [play Renesmee's melody](https://youtu.be/f7NwnzpbQwo?t=78). In that way, it's kind of like a Jacob/Renesmee crossover, although brief and hidden. And similar to Edward's monster theme playing in Twilight's deer intro before we ever meet him, I think it's significant that the first time we're introduced to Renesmee's theme is during the scene of Jacob feeling depressed on the beach. Just like the deer scene, it's like a hint of his coming destiny.

It's so nice to hear from someone who has an invested opinion on the scores -- I could discuss them all day! I also have no expertise or musical background, I just really love movie scores and listen to them often enough to recognize the recurring tropes. I'd be interest to hear about your favorites !",dead-tamagotchi

Exactly what I was thinking, OP. 

Ooh, I hadn't caught that little inclusion, awesome! I also really liked ""Wolves on the Beach."" Good interpretation of the use of the motif! But I'll always lament the lack of the new Jacob theme, it's so gorgeous. If only I were a composer and could mash it up with Renesmee's somehow lol.

Ohmygosh, I could discuss scores all day, too. I'm actually not a big fan of Alexandre Desplat, but I think his ""NM"" score is objectively the best of the series. However, while ""Twilight"" is my favourite, Howard Shore is a very small notch under my top-composer of all time (John Williams), so I have a soft spot for ""Eclipse"". Those are all pretty basic favourites, so if I may recommend something that is a little less well-known: have you seen ""Nocturnal Animals""? I love that movie for multiple reasons, one of which is the absolutely beautiful score by Abel Korzeniowski.

I could go on and on. What are some of your favourites?",GeekSpreadTooThin

Howard Shore‚Äôs Eclipse score is actually my least listened to out of the saga, which is strange since his Lord of The Rings scores are some of my forever favorites. (Nothing beats the Elvish singing!) 

I checked out a few songs from the Nocturnal Animals score and it has such great ambience. I‚Äôll definitely give it a full listen! I love a number of scores from Carter Burwell, but just a notch below him is my other favorite composer, Jocelyn Pook. All of her songs in Eyes Wide Shut gave me chills.

13ipx4,Breaking Dawn PT2 Discussion? (Spoilers!),c74lp3p,2012-11-21 05:47:19,"Hi, guys. I haven't been on this subreddit long and have no idea if you hate my kind, but I am not a Twilight fan. I very much dislike the series. However, if there's anything I dislike more than Twilight, it's the people who blindly hate it. I can't stand such dismissive behavior, so I've been keeping up with the films in order to have a somewhat fair opinion on the story. So with each theatrical release I've gone to the theatre to experience it, and with each DVD release I wait for the price to go down a little and I buy the two-disc edition. I have varying opinions on each as a movie on its own and could give detailed opinions on all of them. But we're here for Breaking Dawn Part 2, so let's do this.

I went into this one, as I have with all the others, having purposely avoided all trailers and plot details so that it'd all hit me fresh. I was actually looking forward to this one, both because it's an ending and because I thought Part One was one of the worst films I've ever seen because of the pacing problems presented by cutting the book in half, so this one had to be better. There was no way it could bore and frustrate me as much as its predecessor. I was AMPED. 

The movie started off on a good foot. Bella woke up as a vampire, and I really liked the ways we experienced her super senses. While we'd been shown the pains of becoming a vampire to great effect in Eclipse, Bella was dead for the awful bit and only experienced the wonders of her new powers. Suddenly waking up in a physical prime, able to experience things far beyond a human's ability was fascinating and carried with it great visual and audio moments. Then she's running, and the effect looks as stupid as it does most times, but I've seen it enough that I don't care anymore. 

So then we run into my first big problem with the film: Bella goes after a human kill and is stopped mid-hunt. What? First off, they've shown us with Jasper and every single newborn how overpowering the thirst is at first. This is bullshit and feels entirely like padding to keep our Mary Sue pure and wonderful. But for the next half hour I can't stop thinking of what a great plot point that would be, what an interesting internal conflict it'd give our hero. She's gotten what she's always wanted all wrapped up in a shiny bow with a loving family, everyone she loves is on pretty good terms, and there's no immediate threat. But on the other hand, she killed a man. Now we have this moral dilemma, all this bullshit that Edward's been preaching about how much it sucks to be a vampire becomes apparent, and Bella has to carry the weight of this with her for the rest of forever. But no, instead she has super self-control. Because why would we want anything to be that interesting, god forbid we make anyone uncomfortable. So it turns out that being a vampire is super great and Bella gets a bunch of superpowers with no draw backs. She doesn't even have to tell her dad that she's dead. I'll point out here that a plot isn't interesting if it doesn't actually bother making the protagonist deal with any problems. Whatever. Let's move on.

So we're finally presented with the big plot of the movie, and the Vulturi (I'm not clear on the spelling) hate Bella's baby without checking to see if they should. Yeah, whatever, these guys have been established long ago as really one-dimensional evil villains, so I'll roll with a baby-killing scheme. If Bella doesn't get to have any internal conflict, why should these guys, right? Right. So now we're going out and getting friends to join our cause and the weirdly aging baby can touch their faces to instantly show them their case because talking is boring and I guess warmth isn't a good enough indication of not being dead. So the psychic powers get everyone on our side and we have a bunch of friends to back us as witnesses and possible soldiers against the evil vampire army, and all this endless third act build up that feels far longer than it should because by all means this should have been one film with the previous one so there's basic pacing problems with the plot and whatever, that's not my problem here. So let's talk about what's stupid here. 

Oh, hey, we're going to the woods to show off and train out special abilities and get ready for a fight, and all the bad guys have their super evil powers and Bella's got a fucking shield along with super strength because why the fuck not, no, FUCK THIS. Fuck vampire superpowers, it hasn't felt like anything but plot devices since the first movie and now we're just taking this too far. This one has electricity? That one makes you see things? Four members of the current Cullen household alone have superpowers? That guy controls the friggin' elements (WHAT THE FUCK IS HE DOING HE'S SO STRONG WHY DOESN'T HE DO ANYTHING)? I'm sorry, I seem to have missed the part where I got up, left the theatre, and found an X-Men movie to wander into. Seriously, what is this? I get that they're supposed to be special, but so many people on their small team have special gifts beyond the already great set of vampire powers that it seems more like you're getting gypped if you can't do anything special. This is dumb. Is the old guy in the Brotherhood of Evil Vampires gonna have magnetic powers? Sure seems like it. I don't know what I'm watching anymore or why.

Well played...",trinnara
13ipx4,Breaking Dawn PT2 Discussion? (Spoilers!),c74lp9y,2012-11-21 05:47:44,"So now let's fight. We're all squared off across this snowy field, and the bad guys far outnumber the good guys even with the wolves because they have an army that's been killing vampires for untold centuries and super evil powers that have made them the unchallenged government system for a race of undead superbeings for so long. Already you should see my problem with what's going to happen. So there's some talking and a lot of crossing the field at a very human speed, which I find stupid for vampires that can operate at superspeed without issue. Whatever. So Alice comes in (I hate Alice so much, I've hated Alice so fucking much since she made her introduction in the first movie) and she talks to Evil Vampire President and discovers to literally no one's surprise that he's a total dick, so the fight starts to start and Carlisle has his little anime jump fight with the Evil President, and the Evil President rips his head off OH MAN COOL. This is the first time the series has done anything remotely ballsy. They've taken our teams moral spine and broken it. They've killed off one of the most likable characters in the franchise. Not gonna lie, I loved that guy. He was everything his character needed to be and charmed my pants off. And now he's dead, and I'm feeling some emotion, and excited about what this means to expect in this fight! 

So now the fight actually happens, and I wish it was as cool as it was in Eclipse. But I knew I couldn't expect that much in this one. We just bop along, some other people die like some wolves I wasn't attached to, Jasper who I was very attached to (GOOD), and a whole lot of those bad guys that totally had every advantage in their favor and are dropping the ball so hard why are they having such a hard time with this whatever. I love how the guy with the element powers (y'know, the guy whose powers are bafflingly useful who doesn't ever do anything) just continues to do nothing until one point where he creates a chasm in the ground. Good going, man! Then he feels like he's done enough and goes back to doing nothing. What an asshole. Then we get to see good guys almost dying and killing the leaders of the villains one after another without much difficulty. 

It's at this point that a realization hits me: Seriously, what am I watching? I don't like Twilight, but I sure as hell came here for a Twilight movie. What is this shit? Where did that story about ridiculous romantic fantasies being played out on a screen go? This sucks. This is heartless, bullshit conflict punching at a scale that not even most superhero stories that I'm so well versed in would go to. Why is this movie nothing but buildup and execution of this huge super fight? It doesn't feel like we're solving any personal dilemmas, we're just wrapping up a bunch of plot with this. I don't like it one bit. This movie is actually worse than Breaking Dawn Part One. I didn't think it could be. At least it'll be over soon and it'll stop letting me down like this.

But oh man, I underestimate the lengths this movie will go to. The big, final piss-off. The be-all and end-all of bullshit that this series could present to me. I'll tell you right now, I was not ready.

NONE OF THAT FIGHT HAPPENED. This entire movie has built to a climactic event that happens in the Evil President's head. It let's us think it's making changes and taking chances, and then takes takes us all back and calls us a fag for falling for it. Fuck you, movie. We end coming to a peaceful resolution that doesn't solve any problems that the movie has shown us since establishing the premise, and everyone walks away just fine to live happily ever after. Bella didn't even solve the problem. Alice used her bullshit plot vision to set up a perfect plan so that Bella wouldn't have to. Our heroes sit back and watch as the problem is actually solved for them. Fuck that. Fuck it in the ass. It's painfully safe and incredibly stupid and has some pretty nice plot holes and it's the only ending that could have made the movie worse than it had been. Good fucking job, Twilight Saga. This truly was a piece of shit. 

**TL;DR -** This movie plays itself too safely, overpowering the protagonist for no real reason, presents a conflict caused only by the flatness of its villains, becomes a shitty X-Men knockoff, loses sight of the story of its own series, and uses its entire running time and structure to build to and show a dumb fight that doesn't actually happen. Everyone lives happily ever after entirely out of fear to do anything else. This is bullshit. This movie is ass. This has probably been the worst film I've seen in theatres. Fuck this movie. The end.

Bella really is the prettiest, most special and bestest vampire ever. She really does have the amazing ability to resist her thirst for human blood. Yes, you're absolutely right, it is ridiculous.

The rest of the book, as far as I remember, proceeds exactly the same as the movie, down to the plodding pacing. Until we come to the final confrontation between the Cullens and their allies and the Volturi. And here, **finally**, the movie rises to become better than the book. In the book we are never shown the fight scene that happened entirely in Aro's mind as Alice showed him the future. In the book Stephanie Meyer, in her laziest moment of writing, merely tells the reader that Aro realizes the mistake they'd make by attacking, so they back down. It really is bullshit.

Think about Star Wars for a second, and how it's geared towards young males. You have a farmhand, Luke, who barely hears about the Force and suddenly he's leading successful rescue missions and performing better at taking down space stations than entire fleets of experienced rebel pilots. He's an absolute newcomer to that world and because he's special, he's besting everyone else. 

Same thing here with Bella. I'm not saying, ""Star Wars did it so it's okay"" but I really think at the end of the day it's supposed to be somewhat of a nice daydream for females. You have to keep in mind the premise is kind of built around being a unhappy regular person suddenly sucked into a mysterious new world where they're now important and a big deal. 

I mean hell, it'd be awesome to wake up one day and find out you have secret powers good enough to carry you into a fight with Darth Vader. It's silly and unbelievable, but it's fantasy. So I don't really agree with the Mary Sue thing in the sense that it's a very typical movie thing.

13ipx4,Breaking Dawn PT2 Discussion? (Spoilers!),c74rp6p,2012-11-21 16:43:34,"The thing about movies based on books is that they can't use that fact to excuse poor conveyance. If you have to read a book in order to enjoy the movie, that's not a good movie. And that's what I'm judging these as. I'm judging the movies as movies. If a film is based on a book it should tell the story as a film, it should change aspects to be more filmic and better portray the events in a visual manner. You can't just translate the visual parts of the book onto the screen and let everyone else sit and spin on it, it should stand on its own. A great example of doing this well that sits fresh in my mind is the movie Hellraiser. It's based on The Hellbound Heart by Clive Barker, telling the story but straying wherever is necessary to more competently tell the story visually, and making changes so that they can tell it with the current technology available when it was made. I watched Hellraiser a good many times, and at no point did I ""need"" to go to the book in order to understand the thoughts of the characters and think it was good. It conveyed those things to me as a film instead of imitating the book.

I'm also not even just watching them to hate them. I can say plenty of good things that I like in the series, and Eclipse was good enough for me to actually like it. I've gone into each movie with an open mind and watched to see what I like and don't like, just like a normal person seeing a movie.

13ipx4,Breaking Dawn PT2 Discussion? (Spoilers!),c75bp0t,2012-11-22 21:14:17,"> Luke was not alone on the rescue mission...

Right, but he also did the whole thing on his own where he grabbed Leia, swung from those platforms heroically while also gunning down stormtroopers - while Kenobi and Solo were off separately. You have to admit that is damn extraordinary for someone who was repairing droids on a farm like the week before. 

There's no real moment like that for Bella - in fact she basically relies on the wolves and vamps to set aside their differences and protect her. She has to be protected in every battle up until the last one, and even then she wasn't able to prevent a few deaths. She ain't perfect by a longshot.

> Luke was special, but not the only special one - there were other Force sensitive characters, such as Vader, who absolutely trumped Luke

Same with Bella - her powers seem to be strictly mental. She also had the added effect of being a youngling(?) which made her physically strong. I'm pretty sure the chick with electric powers or even Emmett could take her out on a normal day. So I think they reinforced how needed the others were.

> She's strong enough to resist her vampire urge, despite having showed no mental resolve up to that point. 

She does, they established this though in the very first movie. Edward was attracted to her because of the weird mental thing she possessed as a human. In vampire form, her mental prowess was enhanced, giving her an edge over other vampires who had ""average"" minds prior to the transformation. Or at least that's how I explained it to myself.

> She goes suicidal without Edward

She wasn't legitimately suicidal though. The only way she could see him was by putting herself in dangerous situations. She wasn't actually trying to die, she just knew the element of danger was enough to get him to contact her. I think it's up to the viewer to decide whether those actions were insane or ballsy.",Baziliy

You have to admit that is damn extraordinary for someone who was repairing droids on a farm like the week before. 

He shot no more or less Stormtroopers than Leia, a *princess* who is as well versed in diplomacy as he is in farming. Remember when he lost the droids, though? He went out looking for them with two items: binoculars and a long rifle. So it's fair to assume from that detail that life on Tatooine ain't all double-sunshine and peaches, Luke obviously has some experience as a hunter, to some extent. The swinging thing was heroic, I guess - I mean, the cable itself is designed for that sort of thing, though. The throw was impressive, but swinging across was not that brilliant, it was just a swing.

Keep in mind that the reason he had to swing was he impulsively shot out the bridge controls, trying to impede their pursuit. That's an *error*. A sign of good characters is that they make mistakes and try to fix the problem, rather than Bella just stumbling through a plot flawlessly.

> So I think they reinforced how needed the others were.

I think your initial point was about Star Wars being a power fantasy for males, yet you're making pretty appropriate comparisons to Twilight. You've accidentally disproven your own point - neither Luke nor Bella are very good ""power fantasy"" characters. Luke, in particular, is no more significant than anyone else really, up until the climax. Bella, however, is placed centrally the entire time. 

> You have to keep in mind the premise is kind of built around being a unhappy regular person suddenly sucked into a mysterious new world where they're now important and a big deal. 

She's important in the sense that it all seems to revolve around her. That's the extent of it though. She doesn't really have a good arc where she begins as needy, useless, dependent on others and becomes ultimately a strong character. She stays needy and desperate.

> She wasn't legitimately suicidal though. The only way she could see him was by putting herself in dangerous situations.

Technically, you're correct. 

On the other hand, it's an absolutely *awful* trait to give a character, particularly as she never seems to grow out of it.

I can't stand Bella as a character, but I won't dare hear her painted as some female Luke Skywalker. Hell no! Farmboy, bumbling redneck who doesn't even know ""What's that flashing"" on the console of a freighter, becomes the greatest Jedi Knight in the universe through hardship, hard work, discipline and, of course, enduring horrible defeats that force him to grow.

2. breaking dawn pt 1, idk why, i just like it haha. the wedding, the island, and the pregnancy is just so‚Ä¶ different from everything else. 

3. twilight, it‚Äôs a classic ofc! i think it used to be my comfort movie/book, but new moon took that spot on my most recent reread and watch. the blue filter is just iconic. 

4. breaking dawn pt 2, bella as a vampire is just ü§åüèº‚ú®. the cgi Renaissance creeps me out but i love the suspense, reading the books i actually felt nervous and anxious for the Cullens on their way to meet the Volturi. 

5. eclipse, EEK, okay, i think the book is good but the movie‚Ä¶ the wigs and the sideburns *gag*, the sideburns haunt me. 

now its time to rewatch the movies lmao",edwardsflu
wml2oj,How would you rank the movies?,ik1doev,2022-08-12 19:52:24,"1) Twilight - nostalgia biased? Maybe. But this movie has *style*, And while perhaps the other films tell stories that are bigger, they don‚Äôt necessarily do it better than the OG

2. Breaking Dawn Part 2 - Whole movie is a lesson in how to pace a film. Even the main score here oozes buildup. Unpopular opinion: I actually like the battle and sometimes wish it had actually gone down. Would it suck to lose three of my top five favorite characters, yes, but I‚Äôd trade them for closure and gravity. All that said, this is a great film with good writing and the one I turn to the second most.

3. Eclipse - my wife hates this one, but it‚Äôs a solid movie if you ask me. I think the issue is that it does take too much focus from Bella, who is more or less relegated to damsel in distress and not an active protagonist. But if you look past that, it‚Äôs a fun movie with good action and lots of excitement. Plus, who wasn‚Äôt ready to kiss Victoria goodbye?

4. New Moon - New Moon is a little uneven in pacing. We have the whole quasi rebound with Jacob arc, which is abruptly shifted to saving Edward. This is fine for the overarching story, but really seems to forget about the first three fourths in the final one. Still a good movie and all, though.

5. Breaking Dawn Part 1 - This ranking isn‚Äôt exactly a demerit of the movie. I just find this movie highly uncomfortable and I usually skip it over. I have a thing about weird pregnancy in fiction that shakes me to my core (despite being a guy), and I just can‚Äôt watch anything with that plot, which is a shame because it IS good and I also genuinely love everything else in the movie, especially the Jacob/Sam conflict.",AlyxxStarr

wml2oj,How would you rank the movies?,ik1wu9t,2022-08-12 22:01:45,"Twilight: OG + Catherine Hardwick. No further explanation

New Moon: It's a cozy, fun, fall weather movie. You get to see more personality / small talk out of Bella. Plus, this is the last movie all of the characters have decent looking hair & makeup. Even though I'm Team Edward, this ones just got some good elements for me.

BD1: Good mix of getting to see some character personality and a mix of conflict / drama. Plus... you know, the honeymoon scenes

Eclipse: worst hair, plot line is very much feeling like a forced bridge between New Moon & BD. So much could have been better from hair, makeup, dialogue, plot points. Actions dont have consequences. But still, not the worst.

BD2: I love certain scenes but mostly don't like Renesme, don't like the renesme / Jacob plot or how much screen time the wolves got. We waited 3 books/4 movies to find out what Cullen family life / vampire life is like and we got an overload of the wolves. Felt very backdoor pilotish. Needed more Cullen fun / character growth scenes.",Silent-Optimist

1. New Moon - I agree. The soundtrack for this movie is just‚Ä¶.*chef‚Äôs kiss*

2. Eclipse - I also enjoyed this movie‚Äôs soundtrack. It had the most action.

3. Twilight - It started it all. 

4. Breaking Dawn Pt 2 - I disliked the breaking dawn movies. This one was better than the first

5. Breaking Dawn Pt 1 - it was boring. There was no need for the last book to be turned into two separate movies. They were just milking it.",poopsikkle
wml2oj,How would you rank the movies?,ik3x9vg,2022-08-13 09:14:26,"# 1. Twilight

**Likes:**

* I love the vibe, the blue filter and all the feels. 
* Lots of great scenes like the biology class scene, the forest (""I know what you are""), meeting his family, Port Angeles, Vampire Baseball, James attack + the vampire bonfire party, the prom.
* Lots of good quotes: ""How you likin' the rain girl"", ""My monkey man"", ""Hold on tight spider monkey"", ""And so the lion fell in love with the lamb.""
* The soundtrack!

**Dislikes:** 

* Scenes that were missing from the book like the bloodtyping scene.
* Not enough Bella/Edward happy times.

# 2. New Moon

I'm going back and forth between New Moon and Eclipse for 2nd place. Right now it's New Moon.

**Likes:** 

* The soundtrack is epic.
* Jacob and Bella's developing friendship.
* Jacob's phasing.
* Victoria being chased by the wolves through the forest with ""Hearing Damage"" playing is just a work of art!
* Reunion with Alice.
* The Volterra Scenes + the reunion with Edward.

**Dislikes:** 

* Depressing for a big part (but well done in terms of acting and ambience). Sometimes it's really painful to watch this part.
* I am frustrated with how Bella took Edward back so easily at the end. She really should have left him dangling outside her window for a few weeks. 
* The hair/makeup department obviously hated Jasper/Jackson.
* The adaptation from book to movie resulted into a lot of the good stuff being cut: Alice' return and her conversation with Charlie, the flight to and from Volterra, the return at the airport etc.

# 3. Eclipse

**Likes:**

* More Cullen scenes.
* Jasper and Rosalie's background stories.
* More wolf pack.
* The proposal.
* The tent scene.
* The soundtrack.

**Dislikes:**

* Book/movie adaptation: more good scenes were altered or completely left out. 
* Emmett's Romulan hairstyle.
* Edward's wig and side burns.
* Bella's mop.
* Replacing Rachel Lefevre with Bryce Dallas Howard! 
* Jacob manipulating Bella into kissing him by threatening with suicide.

# 4. BD 1

**Likes:**

* The wedding and the honeymoon were great, but I would have liked more scenes from the honeymoon and their time as a married couple.

**Dislikes:**

* Different vibe from the other movies.
* The soundtrack started to get more cheesy. 
* The pregnancy.

# 5. BD 2

**Likes:** 

* Bella's transformation.
* The love scenes in the cottage.
* The happy ending.

**Dislikes:**

* Not enough happy times, like seeing Bella adjust to her new life and spending time with her family. 
* BD 2 just felt alien to me compared to the other movies.",ACDaizy

My compulsive self can watch Twilight & stop but if I move on to New Moon, I have to watch the rest because they don't feel as done.  

BD 2: I like the fight scene & I like that Charlie got to a happy place. Love the Jacob wolf reveal & grandpa Charlie coping with the weirdness ""You've grown half a foot; seriously 6 inches."" More relaxed Edward. 

Could go either way New Moon & BD1. I love the very brief normalcy & not depressing Edward (in the extended versions) just before she gets sick.  But New Moon has an awesome soundtrack & mood.

Eclipse: least favorite book & movie. Everyone is awful & stupid at some point. The bedroom/ proposal scene is the only one I really look forward to in this movie.

wml2oj,How would you rank the movies?,ik3imw3,2022-08-13 06:02:33,"From a standpoint of how entertained I personally am while watching the movies, I‚Äôll say:

1)Twilight - Great indie movie vibe. The effects, while corny, work for the action scenes imo. I actually think the lack of CGI and use of practical effects is both charming and beneficial to the down-to-earth vibe. I also love how localized the drama feels to Forks. This is before we learn about the Volturi and realize how complicated the vampire world is‚Äîand it just feels like a small town romance that just so happens to include the supernatural‚Äîit feels like a teen love story above all else. Plot wise, my only gripe is how Edward and Bella seem to suddenly fall into a relationship once she reveals that she knows he‚Äôs a vampire, when before their interest in one another seemed purely out of curiosity‚Äîbut that‚Äôs more of a story flaw than anything else. 

2)Eclipse - More than anything, I love this film and addition within the series because it really feels like the only book/movie where we as an audience are sure that Edward and Bella are solid together. There‚Äôs no wishy-washy *will they, won‚Äôt they* because Edward finally gets his shit together and is gonna stay with Bella for good. Yeah, SM tried to make it seem like Jacob had a chance, but we all know he didn‚Äôt. We also get so much more screen time with the other Cullens, awesome fight scenes at the end, and tons of cute Edward/Bella interactions. Admittedly, I know people might think this one is boring, because the pacing can feel a bit slow, but I actually think it adds to the localized feeling of this specific conflict‚Äîlike this is just something they have to deal with in their town, taking it day-by-day.

3) New Moon - IMO, this is the BEST overall film in the series, story-wise and structure-wise. The cinematography is beautiful, every shot feels purposeful, the soundtrack hits, and Bella and Jacob have great chemistry in this‚Äîand tbh it‚Äôs nice getting to see Bella have more of a vibrant personality brought out by Jacob. With Edward, she tends to soak up his energy and acts a lot more stoic and serious, and I think it would be nice to see them be more playful like Bella and Jacob are. We also get the wolves! And we get to see a lot of personalities within the group, and it‚Äôs a fun juxtaposition compared to how, frankly, boring the Cullens can be. I think I just don‚Äôt like watching it as much because there‚Äôs a lack of Edward in it.

4) BDP1 - I‚Äôll say that I LOVE the first third of this movie, because how could I not enjoy the payoff of 3 movies leading up to a fairytale wedding and a fun and playful honeymoon?? But dear god, the rest of the movie fucking DRAGS. As a concept, it‚Äôs a cool idea, and I think it would actually be a good movie if not in the twilight series‚Äîa body horror movie about a woman carrying a rapidly growing vamp baby. But the idea of it makes the tone of the movie feel so odd. The topic of pregnancy feels like a subject that twilight should‚Äôve never touched, because I feel like it was fumbled. I will admit, I really like how we get to see Edward actually giving a variety emotions, like anger and anxiety and frustration and sadness, compared to how one-note he usually is. UGH AND THEN THE IMPRINTING. Also, I really dislike having Jacob in this as much as he is, ending aside. I feel like after Eclipse, they should‚Äôve strayed away from Jacob, and maybe only have included him here and there.

5) BDP2 - I hate this movie so much. The CGI is actual dog shit, the lines and character interactions feel very weird and stunted. I feel like there‚Äôs a disconnect between Bella and Edward and their literal child, but it also felt that way in the books too, because again‚Äîa pregnancy storyline in Twilight should‚Äôve never happened. Bella just doesn‚Äôt feel motherly, no matter how much they try to convince you that she loves Rigatoni. The inclusion of Jacob just pisses me off lol, because they want to make it seem like now that Jacob doesn‚Äôt feel attraction towards Bella anymore, they‚Äôre all just the best of friends, but he feels really unnecessary at this point in the series. We do get the big fight at the end, which I‚Äôm not even mad about being a fake out. But it all feels so clunky and poorly done. The pacing absolutely drags until the very end; and then the ending feels non-impactful.",

Eclipse - used to be one of my favorites when they first came out. i totally agree the movie downplays Jacob‚Äôs toxic behavior, and does Edward dirty.

wml2oj,How would you rank the movies?,kbeg84s,2023-11-30 13:35:26,"Possibly unpopular opinion: 
I truly think, as a fellow twilight fanatic (I downplay it to anyone I‚Äôve ever known ‚Äòcause no one else I‚Äôve been friends with has been a fan üòì) I think it‚Äôs important, especially as someone who is now (by internet standards) ‚Äúold‚Äù at 29‚Ä¶ everyone who was an OG fan of the books, or even just a fan of the movies, should re-watch them recently in order to accurately rate them. 

I‚Äôm not saying this with any malice or shade, just speaking from personal experience. As someone who has been re-watching them recently, and has done so every 2-3 years, I understand and appreciate so much more from the movies than I did when they came out. Maybe it‚Äôs just me? But it has now been officially 15 YEARS since the first movie came out! (I just googled it, holy s*it!!!) Anyway, I remember being a little mini when the first film was announced and losing my mind with excitement. ü´£

My older sister (who is very much a book-loving, classic novel reading, skeptical and picky human) introduced me to the series when the first book came out‚Ä¶ without telling me the plot, or anything about it. 

She agreed to lend me the first book on the promise that I‚Äôd skip reading/learning anything about it prior to reading the first 5-10 chapters, not learn anything else about it without talking to her first. I had NO IDEA Edward was a vampire when I first read it (thank you, my amazing sister!) and so I got to have all of the mystery, anticipation and excitement of reading it as a blissfully ignorant future fan. 

Speaking strictly about the movies here, in the times I‚Äôve re-watched them, my favourite is based on the feeling I get from the movies vs the books. My favourite *part* of the movies will always be in Breaking Dawn Part 1, the wedding and honeymoon scenes, especially where Edward and Bella go to Rio then Isle Esmee, although I wish they‚Äôd extended and added MUCH more detail to the time period of the characters. 

Best feelings/vibes, which remind me of how I felt when reading the books for the first time, based on movies/scenes from the movies which influenced my choices:

1) Breaking Dawn part 1- Wedding/Honeymoon scenes. Also, Alice and Jasper being so badass with their pre-planning. I also wish they‚Äôd extended the scenes in the movies where Alice/Jasper planned the entire thing‚Ä¶ so beautifully thought out and mysterious. But the movies would be 4-6 hours each if they were to *really* do the books justice‚Ä¶ Plus, it was SO EXCITING when I read the book and Bella became a vampire, since so many of us fans were waiting with baited breath for her to do so. Although the movie cuts off right after it happens, when I watched it in theatres, I was beyond excited waiting for the next movie to come out. 

2) (maybe..?) Twilight, First Film- Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I also have a love/hate relationship with the way it was done. On the one hand, it did give the *vibe* that *I* felt from the first twilight book‚Ä¶ ish. On the other hand, it did seem like it was a low budget film as far as the directing/writing/actoring chemistry went. More like an indie movie than a multi million dollar beginning of a movie franchise that it had yet to become. The colour filters, as far as *mood* goes, did help the vibe, kind of‚Ä¶ On the other hand, the slow-mo, filters, directing, on screen chemistry left a lot lacking. 

3) New Moon - This is number 3 for sadness/depression reasons, not because it wasn‚Äôt good. I tend to avoid this one (or a lot of it) when re-watching the series, for personal reasons. Depression is no joke, so although it was very well done and IMO pretty damn close to the book, out of all of them, it is just too difficult for me to watch a lot of it, so again, this ranking is my *feeling* about the series, rather than a critique on acting/directing/writing/how close it is to the books. As someone who has gone through such intense trauma/depression to understand and relate to the scene in which Bella becomes a numb zombie for several months‚Ä¶ this part, and most of the movie was SO DAMN ACCURATE!  But it still hits a bit close to home. So it is kind of a tie for 3rd/4th. 

4) Eclipse - The budget got bigger for this one, the chemistry for the actors was at a pretty good point, so it made the characters more believable, the story was accurately portrayed. Most of all, I‚Äôd gotten enough time to acclimate to the actors being the characters, so I believed them more, and felt more and more immersed in the story. All of the movies seemed too short, from what I remember of the books, but this one felt very accurate, just too short considering the beautifully detailed backstories of the other characters like Rosalie, Jasper, Alice, Carlisle, Esmee, etc‚Ä¶ but apart from this one seemingly *extra* cut short, it did make me feel, when watching, like I was immersed in the books again.

5) Party because it was split into 2 movies‚Ä¶ Although the budget got higher and higher, the actors had better and better chemistry (familiarity between the actors for so long helped a lot) it felt very rushed at the same time as made for making $ rather than staying true to the books. I know, I KNOW, it‚Äôs the typical crazy fanatic (like myself) argument that the books are *so much better* but it missed so many neat details, like a proper and accurate portrayal of the intricate and brilliant planning on Alice/Jasper‚Äôs part. Also the CGI BABY! Oh my lord, what were they thinking?! I get it, it was decent-ish for the time‚Ä¶ but really. Ugh. Also, the vibe was ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make some money off this cash cow franchise‚Äù rather than ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make a really great film‚Äù. There was so much neat detail in there! Like the reveal of how/where/why they learned about half human/half vampire babies, many of the intricacies of the Volturie‚Äôs involvement (along with the same issue in the other movies) and the way that Alice, Esmee, Carlisle, and even the rest of the Cullen family put every detail into making their home absolutely PERFECT for them. There was just‚Ä¶ so much missed that could have been. 

It almost would have been better to drag it out into another movie than to just simply split Breaking Dawn into 2 parts. 

Ok! Thanks for listening. I‚Äôm new to Reddit and VERY starved of communication with other Twilight fans, as well as being a tiny bit rusty on the finer details of the books, as I haven‚Äôt had the funds/ability/social confidence to buy/read them again when I haven‚Äôt had any friends/family who like them as well. My sister, who introduced me to the book series when it first came out, also became a traitor when the movies came out and the ‚ÄúI *HATE* the cheesy stupid Twilight books/movies‚Äù bandwagon began. 

Thank you all for (hopefully) not downvoting because I was so long-winded and ranted a bit. Also, if you love Twilight as much as I do, let‚Äôs be occasional-long-distance-casual-non committed-Twilight-bonded friends! Lord knows I need at least one ü´£",DelusionalGinger

Robert Pattinson  was well cast IMO.

Definitely looks like a college aged guy in this. But Twilight swings more fade to black NA than YA in many respects with how it was adapted to the movies. Obviously by Breaking Dawn they‚Äôve aged out of YA simply chronologically too, so it‚Äôd make sense why he‚Äôs dressing to look older. 

Bella in the books, I can believe was a teenager though.

1fs9jex,To the people that watched Breaking Dawn part 2 in theatres,lpjait2,2024-09-29 19:07:56,"I was sitting in the front section of the theater, 4 seats from the end of the row with a couple at the end and my cousin next to them. Employees had gone in before/during previews and were filling the gaps of every seat and forcing people to move so they could fill the theater to the max. 

People were screaming/gasping and some guy in the back of theater shouted ""WHAT THE FUCK"" and before the whole theater began reacting to the rest of the fight, *loudly*. For a lot of them it quickly turned from horror to full on cheering whenever they killed a member of the Volturi but here are some notable exceptions that I remember.

The guy at the end of our row sat up and was holding his girlfriend while she cried but they both started cheering pretty loudly when Jane got killed. During the fight some girl in the row in front of me but at the other end kept shouting over and over, ""THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE BOOKS"". Another girl started crying/sobbing which I knew because when it turned out to be a vision, she was still doing it in the theater that went dead silent.

I remember turning in my seat to my cousin during it and we were both horrified at first but also began cheering and clapping. I saw a group of 4 theater staff standing against a wall and watching as well. Their lanyards kept reflecting the light and the one girl in the group had a glow in the dark sticker or patch on her shirt. 

Note: I watched *every* movie in the midnight/first showing (baring the premiere of course) even Twilight when no one else was doing it because my mom was obsessed with the books as well so she took myself, my sister and 2 cousins with her and her friends. When people were leaving, it was all anyone could talk about and the emotional rollercoaster that happened in the scene.

I remember eating fast food with my cousins and we talked about that scene, the montage at the end, and Bella's transformation and how cool it looked with the supervision, etc.

Writing all this out, I think this moment is what solidified my love for the franchise, flaws and all. The energy of the room and how when I texted one of my cousins right now to ask them what they remembered as well (she told me where the girl shouting was sitting and that the girl in the couple next to us was crying) we both paused what we were doing just to reminisce on it and chat about other twilight moments that were that memorable.",GlenBaskervill3

My first reaction was confusion when Carlisle‚Äôs body flopped to the ground in the background as the camera was panning down, because vampires rarely lost balance when landing from big jumps. Then the horror set in as we see Carlisle‚Äôs head and I just screamed bloody murder with tears in my eyes! I was a wreck during the rest of the scene, and seeing Esme and everyone else‚Äôs horror that Carlisle was dead was devastating! Half the people around me had the same reaction, and the rest were just going ‚ÄúOMG what!? That didn‚Äôt happen in the book! They changed the ending!?‚Äù And that‚Äôs when me and I believe the rest of the people watching realized it was possible they could have changed the ending to make it more of a dramatic ending (like a lot of movies do), and we realized that meant no one was safe. So when the other main characters began to die one by one, it just shook me to my core!

tears in my eyes, i felt so unprepared and slightly embarrassed bc the *shock* of the whole situation was so overwhelming, and i wasn't able to regulate my emotions well. I could not tell you if the screaming was the full theater or just me (or me and my friend), and I had a brief feeling of embarrassment but it wasn't enough to get me to stop.

Always check Stephenie Meyer, on social media, reddit page, or usually just her business website that is used as a way to connect to fans. It's on her Fickle Fish section of the site. 

Midnight Sun is going to be released in 2025/2026 as a cartoon on Netflix; Fickle Fish company is going to be the producers and it's her own business. This was hinted at throughout the promotion of the book itself, so I think, Netflix snagged the copyright for the media rights (in 2020). We don't know anything about the characters themselves, and how the characters are designed.

 Obviously as the book is from a different pov, we might see more of the Cullens and how they are seen from Edwards and the backstory of the plot before twilight itself. I hope this means there will be more series in Edwards pov.",Miserable_Block_2589

I think the costume/makeup department eased up on caking the light colored makeup that gave them the chalky look and overly done lips. You can only do so much for the contacts because every person is different with how they react or handle it (I know in Harry Potter they tried to give Harry green contacts to reflect his book counterpart but decided to veto them because they made Daniels' eye's hurt.

Twilight fandom seems to be older on average than some fandoms of newer media that I'm also a part of.

Anyway, here is a [link to an entry of ""mewing"" in the Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mewing), a good source to figure out younger gen's slangs.

>*A technique attributed to a British* [*orthodontist*](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=orthodontist) *named Mike Mew that involves putting pressure on the roof of your mouth with your tongue to try and change the shape of your face by moving your maxilla up and forwards with the* [*lateral*](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lateral) *pressure of your tongue. This fits into the broader* [*looksmax*](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=looksmax) *approach to self-modification in the name of love and romance.*  
  
*Stacy ""*[*Yh*](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Yh) *Chad has some* [*nice ass*](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nice%20ass) *jaw now. He's been mewing for* [*6 months*](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=6%20months) *now""*

[Here is a meme example.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ql5FFGn5x-Q) Mewing is basically training your jaw to look sturdier, more ""masculine.""",csto_yluo

1gdexnx,Kristen Stewart makeup tests for Breaking Dawn ,luf6vc1,2024-10-29 21:52:42,"Mewing is actually just proper tongue posture. Everyone should have their tongue suctioned to the roof of their mouth 24/7 (unless you‚Äôre talking/eating obviously) to keep your airway open and functioning at 100%. Unfortunately ‚Äúmewing‚Äù wont give you a sharper jawline as an adult, but it IS important for children to have proper tongue posture because that suction is what encourages the jaws to grow wide and forward. When you see kids needing things like palate expanders and lots of ortho work, that‚Äôs indicative of low tongue posture. If you CANT achieve tongue suction, you likely have a narrow palate and/or a tongue tie.

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve had experience with a male family member having their partner essentially decide they were going to have a baby regardless of his decision (yes contraception is the responsibility of both parties, but that‚Äôs a different discussion) but there is an argument to be made that having a child affects both parents, but ultimate the mother gets to decide whether to carry it to term and the father gets stuck with that choice.

He was willing to see that happen despite the obvious pain it would have caused him, if it meant that Jacob would have tried and hopefully succeded in convincing Bella to stay alive(aka aborting Rolaskatox)

 For some weird af reason SM decided to make Edward think that Bella was just having baby fever and just wanted A baby, no matter from whom. According to Edward there was a possibility of her being like: ""you know what? Sure! I'll abort little Resume and run away with you Jacob if that means I'll get another baby! That's all I want lol XD""

That to me is such a bad point for Edward's character. It makes it seem like he doesn't understand the love Bella feels for him at all. I thought we were past that since new moon",dirt_devil_696

you know that's kind of a good point, like you'd think even those he has the frozen mental development of a I guess mature or advanced teenager, it kind of shows he's super bad at being a people reader or like just working on empathy or understanding of others.

And I guess if we follow that thought, maybe it shows how his powers have actually crippled him in a way. Being able to read someone's thoughts, you never really have to guess or fully be aware of body language for example.

But from a pro-choice perspective, the issue isn‚Äôt just that Edward was against Bella keeping the pregnancy‚Äîit‚Äôs that everyone around her was pressuring her one way or another. The problem wasn‚Äôt that she chose to continue the pregnancy, but that nearly everyone was trying to dictate that choice for her, whether it was Edward pushing abortion or Rosalie aggressively protecting the fetus at all costs. The lack of agency Bella had in making a fully informed, pressure-free decision is what makes the whole storyline frustrating.

Edward‚Äôs reaction was definitely uncomfortable‚Äîhis anger and desperation were understandable to a point (since Bella was literally dying), but the way he lashed out at her instead of processing his own feelings differently was toxic. 

At the end of the day, Bella chose to keep the pregnancy, and that should‚Äôve been the final say. Pro-choice doesn‚Äôt mean pro-abortion; it means supporting whatever decision a person makes about their own body, without coercion from anyone‚Äîpartner, family, or society.

Never said that his desperation was justified, I said it was in character. And I also said that it was a ‚ÄúWILD‚Äù suggestion. What I‚Äôm saying is it wasn‚Äôt a creepy thing that some people try to make it. 

Edward was grasping at straws with that one and I‚Äôm sure he knew that. I also said at that point he was loosing it and Jacob also basically said the same thing. Jacob entertaining it is also in character for Jacob. I‚Äôm sooooooo not team Jacob, but I can acknowledge that Jacob was an immature boy who thought he was in love so he entertained the idea like an idiot. Edward sent Jacob in to make this offer to Bella, not to hold her down and make a baby. 

Also acknowledging that if my husband the father of my unborn child, turned to my long time emotional fallback and basically saying to him ‚Äúhey since my baby is killing her, maybe she she should have yours instead‚Äù would be literally significantly problematic given that we are both human and my human baby isn‚Äôt going to hurt anyone and my baby and myself can more than likely survive. Keeping in mind that Edward was not only concerned about Bella‚Äôs life, but they were all concerned about what she was bringing into the world. I‚Äôm not against Renesmee‚Äôs existence. I‚Äôm so happy that they had a baby and that Bella kept her (I think that the pregnancy and birth could have been less dramatic) I don‚Äôt even make fun of her name lol I‚Äôm just just able to see all angles. 

You‚Äôre listing all these things controlling, manipulative. He didn‚Äôt say to Jacob ‚Äúokay hold her down and put a baby in her‚Äù he asked him to go present this ludicrous idea to her. Jacob ASKED her and she said no. That‚Äôs all. 

At the end of the day when a man loves a woman he‚Äôll do anythingggggg to save her, even if it makes him look crazy. He most definitely didn‚Äôt consider what she wanted at that moment which is problematic, but it was also a moment that beared no fruit. He took a desperate shot and missed.

Part of the tragedy of Jacob‚Äôs story is that he wasnt allowed to be a normal 16 year old. This is a weird thing for an adult to ask of a 16 year old boy.

Also Jacob volunteered the pack to fight to protect Bella. He shouldn‚Äôt have because it wasn‚Äôt his place but he volunteered. He didn‚Äôt volunteer to become a sperm donor to them. He didn‚Äôt volunteer this idea and then when he said no immediately (because despite being 16 and horny for Bella he still was like: this is kind of gross and compares it to Bella being taken out like a movie at blockbuster) Edward still pushes it because he can see his teenage hormone brain battling his logic and reasoning.

The Cullens have boatloads of money, they could do any amount of IVF if Edward thinks Bella just wants motherhood. To propose a 16 year old boy who hasn‚Äôt had the time to get over his feelings for a now married woman (who admitted to loving him and wanting a life with him but still chose someone else) be the one to inseminate his wife because of their shared connection, is wayyyy too much. It‚Äôs heartlessly selfish at its best and manipulatively deplorable at its worst.

I understand Edward is emotionally stunted and worried about losing the love of his life. This whole scenario is still egregiously fucked up. When I read it when I was younger (12/13/14) I was like ‚Äúoh wow he really loves her‚Äù but from an older perspective it‚Äôs disgusting.

to your point, it kind of seemed to me that Meyer‚Äôs own opinion of women being ‚Äúmarried young and having a child thats a miracle‚Äù comes across stronger than her desire to do well by her own characters. and of course, Bella, who earlier in the book/series is pretty vocally child free falls in love with Radish (as is the experience some women have, this comment is not knocking that) when she realizes the possibility of it looking like Edward, with whom she is intensely infatuated. that to me reeks of the whole idea that it‚Äôs a womans job to not only submit body, mind, heart, and soul to their partner, but that its the most important thing that a woman can do is to give that partner a continuation of their genes. i think that even if Bella giving birth to Rapidash and having Jacob imprint on her was still the end goal of Twilight, it couldve been approached in a more horror/dark romance approach to the idea of a vampire/human hybrid being born to a human and causing their death. my personal two cents",pizzabagelprincess

The wedding kind of makes sense because for Edward's time (and the rest of the Cullens) it was very normal to marry young - getting married was the first step to setting up a life together, and sex before it was frowned upon. If you take the view that Bella is signing up for eternity with him, what's it to her if she gets married? Naive and foolish yes but there is a logic to it. Also part of her fitting in with the Cullen couples in general (again naive and foolish but you can see it).

The pregnancy is just like ... whyyy? But it's not warm and fuzzy by any means.. at least not until after and Bella comes through the other side. Then Jacob imprints and everyone forgets all the stress and trauma and skips off into endless bliss.

A lot of it is written from Jacob's pov by the way, so it's not endless Bella preggo obsessing - but obviously the pregnancy and it's consequences are pretty central. Rhubarb's existence saves the treaty (via imprinting) and draws in the Volturi, so prepping for that is a whole thing.",

But yeah, I get it. I don't find pregnancy or parenthood that interesting in books, and as fun as I thought the second half of BD was, the first half was sort of a drag. Though, Jacob's humor and conversations with Seth and Leah make up for some of it.

If I could change Breaking Dawn, I'd have cut out Renesmee altogether and had the Volturi find some other way to pick a fight with the Cullens, and actually have a fight. Jacob could die in battle for a tragic ending, or fall in love with someone else, like Leah (don't love the pairing but it does make a certain amount of sense) or imprint on one of Bella's friends like Angela for a happier ending.

To make things even ""better"": Do you know the factual reason why we most likely feel that way?

Because, unlike New Moon and Eclipse, Breaking Dawn is not a natural, authentic sequel to the book that came before it.

It's a slightly re-written and re-titled sequel to Twilight, not to Eclipse.

Its original title used to be ""Forever Dawn"", and Meyer wrote it as a direct sequel to the first Twilight book. Everything except some of the wolf stuff was already in there: The wedding, the honeymoon, the pregnancy, the imprint, the vengeful snitch, the Volturi threat, the resolution through Nahuel.

The only thing Breaking Dawn really added was Eclipse-adjacent Jacob being frustrated at his world quite literally being retconned around him, and some of the tribe infighting.

It's really just a destructive, regressive, sloppily re-canonized AU of the second book, not a proper, constructive, trilogy-based fourth installment.

Respectfully disagree, the addition of New Moon and Eclipse helped ease into Breaking Dawn because imagine reading Twilight and then Breaking Dawn, it's way too fast so it's not fanservice, it's listening to construction criticism. Fanservice would be if fans were vocal about how they wanted Twilight to end and since people loved Jacob, she decided to have Bella end up with Jacob instead. *That* is fanservice, listening to your editors isn't.

>Her sloppily re-canonizing Forever Dawn after the new story had long outgrown it was self-indulgent.

Again, not self-indulgent. She didn't say ""I want Bella to have a pregnancy storyline because I want a pregnancy storyline"". She already had the idea of a baby idea stored away after doing research. It's about doing what feels natural to the story's route. Self-indulgent would of been Edward never leaving since she, too hated it, she tried to come up with any idea that would prevent it but none of them worked. He still left, in the end.",KC27150
1gqup63,‚ÄúDoes anyone else feel like there‚Äôs a huge difference between Twilight and Breaking Dawn? ,lx1dz76,2024-11-14 04:24:51,"I think it was initially meant to be a single book but the publisher encouraged her to make it into a series. I‚Äôm sure she had to make up a lot of stuff that was never meant to be a part of her original story.

There was a wonderful comment on a different post a few weeks ago about breaking dawn being a bit bland that I thought made perfect sense. Breaking dawn doesn‚Äôt really capture the magic or allure of being a vampire but is instead a story of Bella just becoming an adult woman. She gets to marry her high school sweetheart, have a baby, live with her family, and keep her childhood best friend. On top of that she has spectacular control over her thirst and powers despite being a newborn. None of it brings any tension or danger. The story just becomes ‚ÄúBella grows up and becomes an adult‚Äù",cloudsongs_
1gqup63,‚ÄúDoes anyone else feel like there‚Äôs a huge difference between Twilight and Breaking Dawn? ,lx1fpsx,2024-11-14 04:37:53,"I think there‚Äôs a few things going on. One is that the first book in a series often involves world building, and that can feel magical to readers. In Twilight‚Äôs case, the world building expanded a bit into the second book because of the werewolves, but definitely diminished in Eclipse. I enjoyed the extensive number of vampires in Breaking Dawn, but it was definitely less groundbreaking than the first book.

Another factor is that an author changes over time. Maybe they‚Äôre jaded, maybe they‚Äôre giving in to fan desires, maybe they‚Äôre overreacting to fan feedback, maybe they got a different editor, etc. It‚Äôs hard to do anything consistently over a decade or more. Everyone changes styles slightly and changes how they work or produce art.

A third factor I‚Äôd suggest is that serialized romance  always struggles. Book 1 they fall in love and he‚Äôs flawless, Book 2 they go through an unexpected trouble, and beyond that you‚Äôre repeating something.

[[source](https://stepheniemeyer.com/the-books/new-moon/new-moon-the-story/)]

But the way the story evolves is what makes it a great story to me. Twilight starts out with classic obsessive first-love and you don‚Äôt want to put it down. New Moon & Eclipse cover senior year when Bella does a lot of growing and learning about who she is outside of Edward. By Breaking Dawn, Bella‚Äôs matured enough to realize she actually does love other people besides Edward.

1gqup63,‚ÄúDoes anyone else feel like there‚Äôs a huge difference between Twilight and Breaking Dawn? ,lx1hmos,2024-11-14 04:52:38,"I haven‚Äôt reread the books but yeah, I know what you mean. Even the movies show it TBH.

A lot of YA series of the time suffer from this actually. 

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs because Stephanie Meyer wasn‚Äôt really a ‚Äútrained writer‚Äú. That‚Äôs not to say she‚Äôs not a ‚Äúgood writer‚Äù. Like obviously her stuff sold. But rather Twilight was her first book from my understanding. And many authors who are published have written maybe 10 books before they even publish. And in the writing world with those 10 unpublished products are practice, and honing your crafting skill as a writer. So in this way, she really is a unique unicorn and special within the writing world to have her first project picked up and published. On top of that, her first project basically doubles are even triple what normal debut first time authors are even allowed to have word count, wise. Like this isn‚Äôt to knock Stephanie Meyer, but there is some valid criticism that you probably could‚Äôve knocked twilight down maybe by a third or 1/4 and still have retained a really good story. 

So my guess is that because of this lack of experience and mastery of her skill, you can really see her struggling and fading. It‚Äôs hard to keep up that pace and keep everything straight. As the Twilight series wore on, I definitely know there are a lot of plot holes and questionable for decisions that were made. I think a really really good. One is her flipping between POV‚Äôs in Breaking Dawn and also her trying to oddly lay out some sort of crime or mystery feel to it. And I felt like she didn‚Äôt execute that well even though I don‚Äôt read crime or mystery. it was like a scatter shot right after you hit the ball to start a game of pool. She had a lot of ideas that she just threw in there which happening first draft but once you edit it, they come out and get smoothed . But I think this goes back to. She just didn‚Äôt have the time.

I think if she had more time between Books, because I think the books came out maybe less than a year apart, we would‚Äôve also seen much tighter and cleaner writing. Like if The Books came out in eight months for us, she probably only had maybe one month and a half to write each book and then another month to edit it once she got it back with notes. And arguably even trained professional writers who do this for a living and pump out mass market fiction that‚Äôs good and marketable struggle and have to really practice the skill. I think a year ago I remember listening to Alexa Done talking about that.

Again, not to knock Stephanie Meyer, but she openly says and admits. This was all born out of a dream. So my guess is that she probably didn‚Äôt develop a future for Bella and Edward outside of that happily ever after fade to black where they get to go to homecoming. And that‚Äôs a perfectly acceptable and happily ever after ending in any romance book whether it‚Äôs adult or young adult. So I think in this way Publishers and the commercial world really driving artistry and storytelling can resulting weaker less vibrant stories. Not always. But I think this might be a case where just did because as the creator and artist here Stephanie Meyer ,just didn‚Äôt have it planned out and she wasn‚Äôt supposed to IMO. She didn‚Äôt have to. It was a perfectly acceptable, paranormal and urban fiction. She used the reality and only changed very small aspects of it. And that‚Äôs good enough for a standalone book. Many adult romance paranormal series do this. Each book in that series is a standalone and that‚Äôs fine. Like a lot of writers can write standalone single books and still go onto to write other amazing stories. But I think being a debut author Stephanie Meyer also didn‚Äôt have the pole or industry to say back off and give me time. But then again, I don‚Äôt know how many big name authors even still get that respect.",BloodyWritingBunny

Twilight and New Moon built up all these paths where some of them should have had devastating consequences, but what we get in the follow up is some injuries in the wolf pack, one dead girl we didn't know until her book came out later, and the Volturi acting intimidating but not actually enforcing anything. 
Breaking Dawn also started out with these crazy high stakes, and ... bupkis.

Bella is fascinated with Edward and the vampires initially in Twilight. It's the beginning of the relationship and everything is exciting because she's learning about this new world that she never knew even existed.

In BD, it's almost like a vampire soap opera. She's pregnant, nearly dies, has a vampire hybrid baby that no one has a clue about, and then the volturi come to kill her and then it never happens because Alice basically sorts it all out. It's great that Bella and Edward have got their happy ever after and that there's some light at the end of the tunnel for Jake too, but it is when everything gets very serious and they all become ""adults"" and just settle into family life.

So in that respect, I just see it as mirroring real life. Your first love is very exciting as a teenager, every day seems like an adventure. Then you grow up, get married, have kids and it all settles down after that.

If your character Steve has a flashback when they're 7 and another when they're 15 just send out a casting call for two brothers aged 5-8 and 13-17. 

For renessme use the fake doll but send out a casting call for 3 sisters all under the age of 8 or 9. You could easily find a brown hair, brown eye set of girls where the 4 year old is her character at 2 months or whatever and then the Alaska trip would be the 6 year old and the finale with the battle is the 8-10 year old.

Like there are a lot of reasons why no one would recognize the person who played Renesmee. And its not all the questionable CGI that was going on. Like yeah...sure I guess she has a similar bone structure but A LOT OF PEOPLE have high cheek bones and around face to be fair.

Like if we actually look at the role Renesmee played in the movies...I don't know if just standing there and looking cute is all that much to talk about. It's like saying ""I was the Tella Tubbies baby in the sun"". They made cute baby/kid basically extras. But they weren't the reason why anyone turned up to watch the movie or TV show to be fair to everyone else. And she talked how much in the movies? How much was she actaully in Breaking Dawn Part II? Like she couldn't have had more than 15min screen time TBH. The only lines I remember he saying were ""Hello Aro"" and ""Jacob!"". That's it. Big whoop?

Like the article EVEN SAYS she one of several kid actresses to wear the clothes of Renesemee. Everyone apparently thought someone called McKenzie Foy was Renesemee? And the article says she hit big? So I guess my next question is. why wasn't the kid turning her ""starring role"" in Twilight into something big like that kid?

Maybe I'm just feeling cynical at the time of writing this but...maybe its not a bad thing you aren't remembered for one of the most questionable parts of Stephanie Meyer's story and the film adaption? Like in both places everyone was like ""um...okay...but uh...WTF?""

Specifically about the conversation jacob and edward have in breaking dawn to me that speaks more to how out of his mind upset he was watching the life get sucked out of the person he‚Äôs dedicated his life to. normally that isn‚Äôt something he would consider but he‚Äôs out of his mind thinking bella is going to die and if there is just some way to make her happy and keep her alive he‚Äôd do anything. 

With jacob‚Äôs pov you are seeing inside his head, not all of the things he thinks are his actions. If someone were able to read my mind they‚Äôd be able to judge me for a lot of odd things I have thought about but don‚Äôt agree with and wouldn‚Äôt actually do but i think about. Like the eclipse when jasper briefly considers having bella in the clearing during the fight. edward says that to jacob and he thinks about it but i don‚Äôt think he would participate in that and shouldn‚Äôt be judged for thinking about it.

 I feel like a lot of the time the critiques about the characters behavior in twilight(and other paranormal stories) aren‚Äôt fair because people apply our world morality and expectation. i don‚Äôt think the things they do always acceptable but i do think they can‚Äôt be criticized the same way a human being in our world would be.

Also, I don‚Äôt know how either of them thought raising a human child, especially a human child with the wolf gene, around a bunch of vampires is a good idea. And if Bella just has a regular human child and becomes a vampire, she‚Äôd eventually have to watch her kid die. And if she didn‚Äôt have as much self control as she did when she was turned, she wouldn‚Äôt even be able to be around her kid for at least a year.

Your experience is valid, but there was nothing titilating about that scene from my perspective. Yeah Jacob was being weird about it but that's Jacob for you. He's possessive and gross. It feels more uncomfortable than wish fulfillment. Same with basically every interaction he has with Bella in Eclipse. He's harassing and manipulating and assaulting her. It's not hot. I didn't feel like I wanted to be in Bella's shoes. 

(Though for that it's true that Stephenie thought it was romantic and didn't see the second kiss as an assault. Which is why Edward didn't react to it like it was. But like she's wrong. She did write it as an assault. And the way she wrote Bella ""realising"" she was in love, while she was scared and confused and hating herself, felt more like some kind of dissociation or breakdown than a moment of clarity.)

I do get where Edward was coming from in BD too. He wasn't objectifying Bella; he was just trying to think of a compromise she might go for. And if Bella did want to have a kid with Jacob while being married to Edward, and everyone involved was cool with that, great, more power to them.

>!p.200-201, Breaking Dawn.!<

>!Bella is pregnant with the half-vampire, half-human spawn. Edward thinks the baby will kill Bella and is desperate to try and persuade her to abort it. Jacob comes to visit Bella. Edward pulls him aside and says:!<

>>!If it's a child she wants, she can have it. She can half a dozen babies. Anything she wants... She can have puppies, if that's what it takes.!<

>!Jacob then thinks:!<

>>!What was he saying? That Bella should, what? Have a baby? With me? What? How? Was he giving her up? Or did he think she wouldn't mind being shared?!<

>!To which Edward replies:!<

>>!Whichever. Whatever keeps her alive.!<

>!So Jacob then thinks:!<

>>!I couldn't think about what he was suggesting. It was too much. Impossible. Wrong. Sick. Borrowing Bella for the weekends and then returning her Monday morning like a rental movie? So messed up. So tempting.!<

>!Essentially, he thinks that Bella just has ""baby fever"" and is scared to abort because she really wants to have a child. So, Edward asks Jacob to propose to Bella that he can impregnate her as much as she wants (with babies that will not kill her) while Bella simultaneously stays with Edward. Basically, Bella gets both options. It's very strange.!<",lovelillith333

And Edward responds:

>Whichever. Whatever keeps her alive

Then again, this is repeated in Jacob's thoughts:

>I couldn't think about what he was suggesting. It was too much. Impossible. Wrong. Sick. Borrowing Bella for the weekends and then returning her Monday morning like a rental movie? So messed up. So tempting.

So from the text it's pretty clear that they essentially would be ""passing her around"" - in the sense that she would be having relations with them both in this strange scenario. I mean, maybe it wouldn't have worked out in the long run, but that is what Edward is suggesting. He is absolutely not saying that he's going to leave Bella if she chooses Jacob here.",lovelillith333

You yourself said Jacob has been weird and gross, so perhaps that's it because I haven't liked Jacob since the whole Eclipse thing and always think he's pushing Bella too far. So far that it's just getting annoying.

And I suppose it is gross that Jacob is actually considering the thing, knowing Bella wouldn't want it, that she isn't someone that would be into it. Same case with Edward.

1dkl68c,Does anyone LIKE Breaking Dawn?,l9q6bv7,2024-06-22 05:42:59,"I enjoy bits and pieces of breaking dawn. I loved being able to see Bella be a vampire and her new senses and learn how to use her gift. I also LOVED any speck of Volturi content. 

I have never liked the pregnancy/Renameme plot line because Bella didn‚Äôt want kids and that was ruined AND because Bella never had to live with the consequences of becoming a vampire like she wanted. For example she didn‚Äôt lose Jacob or Charlie, like becoming a vampire should have cost her. 

I think Renameme is a cool horror concept (instant adult trapped in a body playing catch up for 7 years with an unneeded & unrelenting want for human blood?? That‚Äôs a horror movie I would see.), but I don‚Äôt feel she fits well into the Twilight universe. I also hate the imprinting, I‚Äôve never liked how it was done but breaking dawn really drove that home. 

Jacob HATED Renameme but the second he imprints those feelings are GONE. He doesn‚Äôt get to work through them or anything, they‚Äôre just erased and suddenly he HAS to do anything and BE anything that makes the demon happy including letting her bite him during her tantrums. There‚Äôs even a part in the book where he‚Äôs horrified by something but compelled to clap for her since that‚Äôs the reaction she wants in that moment. 

Also, Renameme is born with a fully developed brain and all inherent knowledge that goes with it but has to wait 7 years for her body to catch up while Jacob is 16 whose shifting forced his body to age to and then freeze at fully developed. So, while both of their brains are fully developed Jacob is still only 16 since he, unlike his imprintee, doesn‚Äôt get an instant adult brain with knowledge, just the brain itself. 

Either way you look at it, creepy af AND while Renameme has all of the control in the relationship because she‚Äôs the imprintee and gets to pick what relationship she wants from the imprinter (brother, friend, protector, lover) since whatever the imprintee wants, the imprinter must provide why would she go out and find any other potential romantic partner when she has someone who literally can‚Äôt say no to anything she may want since their life‚Äôs purpose is to do and be anything their imprintee wants. 

The imprint as Smeyer wrote it is literally magical slavery that makes the slave happy to serve by erasing any resistance they had and that only happens to the native characters whose culture and name she‚Äôs stolen and misrepresented. It‚Äôs fucked. The vampire version of ‚Äúimprinting‚Äù is that once they feel strongly for someone their feelings never fade, so they get to choose who they‚Äôre attached to and they‚Äôre not compelled to do anything they don‚Äôt want to.",Lilith_Mornings

People seem to take issue with the fact that things are ""easy"" for Bella, but that's not my perspective at all.

There's an entire chapter dedicated to describing the absolute hell that Bella goes through while becoming a vampire, which always explained to me why she, similar to Carlisle who also burned in absolute silence, has an easier time with controlling her thirst because she practised insane self-control for the two days or so that she burned. After describing the torture she was going through as clinging to the burning stake rather than being tied to it, what could possibly be more difficult to control?

I‚Äôm glad we got Breaking Dawn for the slow boil lead-in to Edward and Bella‚Äôs marriage and her subsequent change into a vampire complete with a biological child and peace with the Quileutes, but it didn‚Äôt feel as high-stake as a massive army of Newborn vampires raised with the purpose of avenging the villain from the first book. The driving conflict in Breaking Dawn was pretty self-contained so take that away and you could‚Äôve fit it into a few more chapters of Eclipse.",Giantrobby1996

I took my 14 yr old daughter to the midnight showing of Twilight, in 2008, and was really disappointed. The movie was not the way I thought it would be. I expected to hear more of Bella's voice throughout the film, and the tree scene, which I now love, was more like a wtf moment for me. Anyway, fast forward to BD and I was so happy with the way it turned out. Except for that one infamous scene, the movie was a spot on adaptation of the book. I also was blessed to have seen every Twilight movie with my daughter, who is now 30. To this day, we are still Team Edward and cry at the end of Breaking Dawn.",

1dkl68c,Does anyone LIKE Breaking Dawn?,l9jupp8,2024-06-21 01:09:00,"i love the book and movie!

it would have been perfect if Jacob didn't imprint on an actual infant but i guess SM primed us for that when Quil imprinted on 3 year old Claire and Jacob explained it to Bella. I would much rather have seen Jacob with Leah in a sort of fuck wolf imprinting, let's go against it on purpose, kind of relationship. but then the problem would be what happens if either one of them DID find their true mate (but that would occur outside of the twilight series anyway since it ends with breaking dawn so not really an issue)

i know the imprinting was necessary for the wolves to not kill the Cullens but there hadddd to be another way üò≠ Sam was ready to just let Bella become a vampire and mind his business, they just got pressed about the unknown potentially immortal child. (side note, do the wolves even know what immortal children are? or have they only ever encountered adult vampires)

seems like when Bella was pregnant, the Cullens should have just moved away and never told Jacob or Charlie. Bella has to be dead to her mother Renee anyway, it just seems fair that Charlie gets the same treatment of her never seeing him again. although she put him through hell in her 18 months of living in Forks lol (and for 6 of them edward wasn't even there!)",piercethevelle

At one point Edward calls Emmett and Jasper ""Em and Jazz"", nicknames which have never been mentioned before and are completely out of character for all of them.

1dkl68c,Does anyone LIKE Breaking Dawn?,l9nbl7w,2024-06-21 17:52:58,"I sometimes skip BD on my rereads. There‚Äôs a lot of things I don‚Äôt like about it, and a lot that I do. 

Bella is such a plain and average girl ‚Äî so anyone can relate to her. But then she gets all horny and starts hopping on Edward whenever she can like okay, yeah, I do that with my SO too‚Ä¶ but *all* of her relatability flies out the window as soon as she finds out she‚Äôs pregnant. 

It‚Äôs an unfortunate trope in romance novels, which I also love, that at the end the woman ends up pregnant and they have their baby and their happily ever after. I‚Äôm a fencesitter who‚Äôs mostly leaning on the side of never having kids. But I hate the idea that authors force on the readers, that your relationship and your life isn‚Äôt *complete* until you have a baby. It‚Äôs one of my biggest pet peeves when I read any romance. 

Once Rhianna is in the picture, Bella‚Äôs entire world seems to revolve around her and around fucking Edward as soon as the sun goes down. Edward, who was the center of Bella‚Äôs universe, takes backstage. He stops being relevant to the story so abruptly, after 3 novels of him being THE story. Now he‚Äôs just in the sidelines to get Bella off at night and then stop existing during the day. I‚Äôd rather Meyers had killed him, if she were going to make Rainmaker Bella‚Äôs (and the other Cullens‚Äô! AND Jacob‚Äôs) entire life. It would be more interesting to see how Bella handles that grief while staying around for Edward‚Äôs kid, realizing it‚Äôs not healthy or sane to off yourself after your partner dies. 

i do like seeing Bella finally become a vampire. Her confidence blossoms, we get (this was before MS) to experience what being a vampire is like‚Ä¶ but I hate that it's so easy for her. She just wakes up overpowered and totally normal. You're telling me that the instincts of a newborn vampire are so powerful and scary that the Cullens have to isolate themselves from society for a handful of *years*, but for Bella it's fine after a week? 

Bella never really struggles for what she wants. I guess the awful, bone shattering pregnancy could be suffering? But even then, it's for all of a month or two and then she's a beautiful vampire with the self control of Carlisle *and* her shield power. 

Whenever I read BD I can't help but picture everything I would do differently as an author and it takes me out of the moment. The first time I read it, I put it down for weeks after I got to the part where she got pregnant. I wish that the fetus actually *was* a monster, that Bella was completely wrong and actually has a consequence for her stubborn and awful choices for once.

All of that said, I am a sucker for happy endings. I did like that Bella got her vampire goal, that the Volturi didn‚Äôt kill them all. That she gets to live practically forever with Edward like she always wanted.",RedeRules770

I read in an FAQ on Stephenie Meyer's website that she said she doesn't know how they could adapt BD to film (must have been before the movie came out) since Renesmee is supposed to look mature, and the only way you'd be able to do that is with CGI. She straight up said CGI humans look wacky and fake, so she doesn't think it would work for Renesmee. But then I guess that ended up being the only option haha.

1dkl68c,Does anyone LIKE Breaking Dawn?,l9q7jgt,2024-06-22 05:55:42,"The Imprinting is such a fucked up thing in the series. It‚Äôs literally supernatural slavery that conveniently only affects the quileutes. 

Renameme is a horror movie concept that‚Äôs cool outside of Twilight, and away from Jacob, but in Twilight she‚Äôs terrible. Did you know she‚Äôs born with a fully developed brain and all the inherent knowledge that comes with it? She‚Äôs basically an instant adult that‚Äôs just waiting for her body to catch up. Jacob is 16, and while he is also in possession of a fully developed brain, thanks to the rapid aging his shifting caused, he doesn‚Äôt have the developed knowledge to go with it. 

I 100% would have loved to have seen Jacob imprint on Leah, or maybe one of Bella‚Äôs friends like Jessica/Lauren/Angela rather than Renameme. Can you imagine how Bella would have reacted to that? Especially since Jacob would probably tell them about vampires too and then they could have drama about the Cullens being vampires or something. 

We also could have had the drama about Bella being changed/the treaty and it being fixed by one of the visiting vampires Carlisle calls for *insert reason here* being imprinted on since Smeyer insists on using that to fix plot issues. Imagine what a wild ride that would have been.",Lilith_Mornings

1dkl68c,Does anyone LIKE Breaking Dawn?,l9ncx8k,2024-06-21 18:00:29,"Now that I‚Äôve rambled mostly about what I don‚Äôt like:

I loved meeting other vampires. Garret (Garreth?) being one of my faves, and the Amazon vampires. I loved the Romanians and would REALLY LIKE a small novel about them in their prime and their downfall. 

I loved that Leah got to escape from Sam and start healing. (I wish she and Jacob got together, that would‚Äôve been perfect imo. A really great conflict ‚Äúwhy are you hanging around protecting the girl you *used* to love?‚Äù). I loved seeing more Seth, the cute little puppy that he is. 

I loved that she still got to keep in touch with Charlie, who didn‚Äôt deserve to lose his only child *again* and I loved that Bella basically got a permanent relief from Renee, who was NOT the greatest mother. And I loved that Charlie was finding love again with Sue after all those years. 

I did appreciate Jacob‚Äôs POV. Meyers is great at writing different perspectives in the same story, something I struggle with myself as an author. Meyers is one of my inspirations despite my creative disagreements with the way she handles some of her works, and I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs influenced my writing style more than any other author I‚Äôve read.",RedeRules770

1dkl68c,Does anyone LIKE Breaking Dawn?,l9s4yc3,2024-06-22 16:28:05,"Yeah it is kind of odd. I wonder if the imprintee is also somehow ""destined"" to be with the imprinter, but the physical/mental/emotional/whatever draw only comes from the imprinter? So it's not like the imprinter has to hold their person hostage or anything; the imprintee is totally fine with the companionship, they just didn't \*think\* about it until the moment it became relevant.

I wonder if there are any examples out there of imprinting gone wrong? Like if the imprintee wants NOTHING to do with the imprinter? Or if there was ever a couple that was together before the imprinting happened, but then the imprint worked out so they were ""soulmates"" anyway? Lol not sure. Kind of like Alice's visions, imprinting feels like lore that could be better explained. Or maybe there's an explanation that we haven't seen yet. Idk but I feel you",Beatrice033

He literally says ""the body that I love."" She is just a body to him. And he makes that immensely clear throughout the series. She isn't ever allowed to make decisions for herself on his watch. He blatantly and frequently disregards her boundaries, gaslights her, guilts and degrades her, and flat out assaults her too. He doesn't care about her as a person. He cares about her as a pretty body. And he very plainly admits that here.",ChipmunkFantastic214

Critical thinking can't outweigh a supernatural force like that. 

For example, Jacob detests imprinting and sees it as disgusting, unfair and immoral, until it overwrites his brain. 

Bella's autonomy is canonically compromised. 

>Well when he finds out that she is marrying the person she already told him she was choosing he threatens to go kill himself as an obvious guilt trip into Bella kissing him. 

Marrying Edward equals an untimely death. He, at the time, feels like he can't live without her, so why bother?

It's sick behavior, but literally everyone is sick and broken by that point. 

At least he almost got her to stay alive with it. 

But, just like with the thinking, natural emotions can't outweigh supernatural ones. 

>I‚Äôm sorry, but if you don‚Äôt think thats a red flag in a guy, well, I don‚Äôt think anything I could say would change your mind. Apologies if you took offense

Jacob doesn't need any flags by that point. He's a deeply broken young man, throwing out his morality to try to save his lover's life. 

It's all messy, it's all ugly, it all sucks, for all of them.

Instead of a shield think of her powers like a bubble or force field. The field blocks whatever is outside of it. Bella can expand the bubble to include Edward inside of the bubble. Since he is inside he is no longer being blocked by the bubble and therefore she no longer has anything blocking Edward from her thoughts.

19e1c01,Wtf Breaking Dawn Part 2,kjo1rnn,2024-01-26 15:25:55,"Heads up, this my comment has a lot of book spoilers.




1. Bella doesn't choose whether or not to see Charlie again. In the books it goes more into it, but she couldn't handle giving him up and so Edward let her keep talking to him to placate her while pregnant. She made plans during this time to spend a year away so her eyes would change. Then she would allow her dad to come to his own conclusion which would be most likely incorrect. Jacob forced it.

2. Bella in the movies doesnt look much different, but bella in the book looks drastically different. She hardly recognizes herself and is genuinely scared. When charlie sees her he isnt sure its her and is scared as well. 

2.5 The reason she is so calm is because Bella has abnormal self control. In the books jasper is constantly upset because he doesn't understand it. They go into this more in the book, and Carlisle muses that her preparation beforehand made a big impact. This is one of her abilities, self control. She skips her newborn stage which is why she is able to withstand the temptation.

3. Charlie does get suspicious of it, but in the books he specifically states that he doesn't want to know anything. He'd rather ignore everything and have her in his life. He knows things are weird but chooses to start thinking about it, because he loves his daughter. He is a bit miffed she didn't warn him though and that she didn't let him know that she was getting involved in something.

5. Edward and Bella were a 1 time occurrence and hadn't ever happened before. The only cases of vampire hybrids didn't have the mother survive and are so rare because resisting human blood is nearly impossible for most vampires. The only known cases of vampire hybrids were from South America made by Joham who fathered Nahuel and a few daughters. He wants to create a super race of hybrids and is now on the radar of the Volturi.

5.5. SMeyer explains that while female vampires can't get pregnant because it requires a bodily change, male vampires can still father children because  their ""sperm"" is actually venom that carries their genetic data.

7. In the books, Bella works really hard to learn how her shield works and learns how to remove her shield. While it seems lame in the movie, they didn't show how much effort she put into learning how it worked. The reason the memories seemed choreographed is because she had planned ahead what memories to bring up because she didn't know how long she could keep her shield down. 

7.5 I believe the reason they showed her in the memories was just for the audiences sake. In reality it would have been POV.",ghostlyhero3

They did Charlie dirty, but if you watch closely, she promises to be in his life from then on, and so he will not be excluded.. how they'll deal with the growing child is not explained...

Edward and Bella fight beautifully...love how he swings her around and she side kicks Aro and then takes him out eventually.

19e1c01,Wtf Breaking Dawn Part 2,kozkcep,2024-02-05 05:23:43,"Yeah the last scene in the movie was just stupid to me. It was sloppy but fitting for the era it was shot in and designed for (2011-12?) how is Bella showing her memories of her life in third person? As if she‚Äôs not the one remembering it? She‚Äôs showing Edward milestones and moments from throughout her life from infancy to present day and it looks like the directors and editors were tired and wanted to rap it up with some fluff. It didn‚Äôt necessarily make sense and they could‚Äôve done better.¬†

Most of your points just solidifies the many blatant mistakes that SM made in this last book/movie. Bella should‚Äôve never been able to get pregnant. It was completely out of left field and felt like she had an agenda. Bella expressed that kids gross her out (superficially the snot, sticky fingers, germs, etc. and we never got beyond that reasoning) and she was more than willing to give up that opportunity to be with Edward forever. SM just wanted to make Bella have her cake and eat it too. She was ‚Äúselflessly‚Äù willing to sacrifice these things for Edward so in return she gets rewarded and showered(pick-me behavior, Peggy sue syndrome). And can be around her baby because it doesn‚Äôt smell too much like a human, and the most self-sufficient baby that doesn‚Äôt need much work or maintenance. (The pregnancy storyline honestly felt like a slap in the face for all of the other female vampires and Leah who were dealt unfair cards, and had to come to terms with their infertility) ¬†

Another cop out was Bella‚Äôs self control, people swear up and down that Bella had time to prepare for vampirism while others didn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs simply not the case. Again SM wanted Bella to have her cake and eat it too. Bella didn‚Äôt know what to do about her father. There wasn‚Äôt a clear plan yet and the cullens dropped the ball on this one by dragging out the story of Bella being sick and letting her still communicate with Charlie. The entire series also takes place in less than 2 full years. In those 2 years, Edward and the cullens also abandoned her for almost 7 months and she had no clue if they would come back to forks. If anyone wants to look up the timeline for the series it‚Äôs here on Reddit as well as other places. IMO that is not enough time to prepare yourself for a life-changing decision like this; genetically altering your DNA into a predator.¬†",

You can't be a cop, especially Chief and be dumb. In Washington state you actually have to have a Masters in Criminology. He's also went through detective training. I never understood why SM made every character other than the Cullens appear like idiots. Edward proves that you can have years of education and still have no common sense. Bella has absolutely none. 

As I've gotten older and read the books in my 30s the more the teen characters annoy me. The best characters were those that had life experience. 

Bella and Edward to me always came across as spoiled brats needing everything to be their way or they threw a temper tantrum. Nothing or no one else mattered; not family, or friends unless they got what they wanted. Example...Bella's turn me or else, running off in Phoenix, and all of her in New Moon.

And the cottage was so Edward and Bella could have alone time since Renesmee was already asleep and was consistently sleeping through the night anyway.",Poncho_TheGreat
155detz,Breaking Dawn part II,jsvwz29,2023-07-21 16:38:53,"I actually just re-read this part!

As other commenters are saying, Bella really wants to see Renesme but they keep delaying her because they're worried about how she'll control her thirst. Remember that newborns are supposed to be incredibly wild, strongest vampires in the room, and uncontrollable.

When Bella wakes up as a vampire, Edward mentions her thirst and she realizes that it's super painful so they have to go hunting first. She almost kills a hiker but doesn't, so they trust her a bit more

She wants to go back to see Renesme so they do, and Jacob comes out first to test it. She's good and gains more trust there, so she sees Renesme. She says she smells good but not in a food way, probably because of the half vampire part. She stays with her until she falls asleep, confirms that she sleeps through the night, and then Bella is taken to see her surprise gift - which Bella didn't know was a house, so she wasn't planning on leaving for the night, but got caught up in the super electric vampire love lol.

As soon as dawn breaks the next morning, Bella wants to go see Renesme. She then moves her in to the house that night.",NotJayphy

I believe it's morning she wakes up, they hunt for an hour or so, then when she returns and has the fight with Jacob, she then stays with Rigatoni until she falls asleep and night comes (latish in Sept I guess) before going to the cottage. There's no specific set times for how her first day is, but she is with her as long as she can before they gift them the house, then they go back fairly early if I recall the next day, with Riggs sleeping in the cottage onwards after that first day",Nateon91

155detz,Breaking Dawn part II,jt7vpj3,2023-07-24 06:27:14,"Like full disclosure, I wasn't nor am I a Twilight fan (I was 14 at a sleep over and a friend sprung the  BD pt1 movie on me). But I recently (now age 23) found a website that had the full Breaking Dawn book that I had to read because (I didn't want to buy it) I had to know if the book actually had sex scenes in it (spoiler they don't). Why?  Even after all that time I couldn't get that nostalgia inducing, toxic-relationships  promoting-franchise out of my head.  ""What ever do you mean?"" I.e. the toxicity of Edward and Bella's relationship,  Emily and Seth equal love ... um no and so on and so forth. That's all beside the point. Maybe it also had to do with how pretty they made all that twistedness look... 

So I read the whole book.  Everything before this has been basic Bella being so consumed about Edward, his world and his needs she's willing to die, throw away everyone and everything, to be with him. Which leads to here, Bella marrying him so that they can have sex. Honestly, I felt like the whole Renesseme plot was out of nowhere when all Bella wanted was immortal vampire sex with Edward. Then all of a sudden she wants to birth this baby. I can't even say she wanted to be a mom. From reading the fandom page nowhere in any of the other books does it list her as having a motherly instinct or desire. Yes, she had to ""care"" for her mom and Charlie, but even I'm in that situation,  at 23 I care for my 51 year old disabled mother and I don't have this urge to pop out a baby and be a mom. If that characteristic were a character it would definitely be Rosalie or even Esme. 

Back to the discussion, don't worry I have receipts. Okay so, Bella wakes up a vampire and the book goes on about her new vision ability and continues  on for paragraphs about how beautiful Edward is and how she can't stop  staring at him or how when they kiss it's like they're the only ones in the room. Bella then thinks of Renesme yet shes reminded of her thirst and has to hunt. After her first kills she remembers her lust for Edward much that she  is  consumed  with wanting to jump him. He reminds her of their daughter. Okay, I get them being sketchy about her attacking defenseless Primeribe smelling Renesme but Bella has super self control and everyone's cool.  Like what? (I'm not even going to start about Jacob imprinting on a fresh out the womb baby) I want to see her gravel and grow by realizing giving up humanity has consequences  and this new perfect life wasn't as ""perfect""as she thought.  But noooo give everything to Bella tied in  a red shiny bow. Like really she even gets to keep Charlie for however long he lives.... Ugh. The freakishly beautiful baby sleeps and Bella can view her dreams. Then she gets gifted the cottage and they have hot vampire sex with no details. The next day she has to see her daughter. I get others saying they move her into the cottage. But from what I recall reading, it was always Bella walking in to Rosalie or Jacob tending to the baby she risked death and ultimately died for. There's nothing about Bella feeding her, changing her diapers, bathing her, rocking her to sleep, doing her hair, picking out her outfits, readings bedtime stories, tucking her in, washing her overly used favorite stuffed animal,  flying through the woods with Renesme on her back like Edward did her....nothing satisfyingly ""normal"". 

Bella fought so hard to keep this baby alive yet nothing about her mentally screams mother. Another thing, when she's in transition she doesn't want to make a sound so that Edward doesn't know shes in pain because hurting him hurts her. BUT WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT SHE DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN HOW HURT EDWARD WAS THAT THE BABY WAS LITERALLY SUCKING HER LIFE AWAY AND THAT THE BABY COULD KILL HER BUT OKAY BELLA. Also there weren't enough of Edward and Renesme bonding like yeah he can communicate with the baby and realize it's not trying to be a threat to Bella and yeah after it's  born he composes her a lullaby and knows all this stelf mind stuff but I was still left wanting more cute moments with he and her or them as a family excluding -the-creep-lurking-2feet-away- Jacob.

1kovs26,Breaking Dawn Part 2 thoughts,msufx08,2025-05-17 20:02:57,"Well while Stephanie Meyer didn't crbon copy everything from historical vampire lore and in the modern vampire universe, werewolves smelling horrible to vampires still very much existed in her world. Beyond her university, some vampires can't stomach it or even maybe die from drinking werewolf blood.

But also on a basic instinct level, Jacob on a moral level and probably with every fiber of his being, would not allow that probably. There are just some lines not worth crossing.

From the Cullens perspectives, beyond the nasty smell, I doubt they see Jacob as any different than they see humans on a moral level too. While he might not smell appetizing, drinking his blood would probably really be very little different than human blood to them on a moral and philosophical level.

Plus, even though I haven't read it personally, I'ver heard it reported on this subreddit they aren't actual werewolves like lycans/lupus/whatever a real werewolf is. But something different than that so...maybe Jacob and the Quiliutes from the books are even more human or completely human in this universe that just have magic abilities. They're often called Shape Shifters on this sub for that very reason actually. A clear distinct is made somewhere in some of the supplementary materials by Stephanie Meyer I believe.",BloodyWritingBunny

I do think it was strange to send Carlisle off when they knew that Bella was getting to the end. 

Another plausible thought would be why they didn't hunt FOR Carlisle. I mean they're supposed to be super strong so why couldn't they capture an elk or moose to bring to the house so Carlisle could feed off it.

Edited because I am not really sure about the exact time",CSilver80
1jzgkvg,How old was Bella's daughter in breaking dawn part 2?,mn943hw,2025-04-15 15:59:31,"She says three months pass. Renesmee was born a couple days before Bella's birthday (in September), and the Volturi come around New Year's (can't remember if it's New Year's Eve or New Year's Day). 

Bella also says Renesmee looks about the size of a small 2 yr-old or big 1 yr-old. She hadn't changed much from the time Irina saw her to when the Volturi came, but she'd changed enough that Irina was starting to doubt herself.

There's a very handy timeline near the end of the Illustrated Guide, which is where I pulled some of this info from (what I didn't get from Breaking Dawn that is).

I believe the filmmakers aged Renesmee up faster for the movie because CGI wasn't quite where it needed to be and because it's expensive. But per the book, she was the size of a small toddler.",RedOnTheHead_91

So actually, what exactly is wrong about that question?
Why tell her to Google if she is asking in reddit ( a lot of Google answers will guide people here anyhow)

If someone watched the movies just one time, or did read the books once a long time ago, the reasons for that might have slipped.

A simple confirmation would have been ok.

You wrote several long comments in another post how vampire and human DNA might work together, I actually liked those thoughts, having biological work - background myself.

I'm stunned why I get that much hatred from you 

I do apologize nonetheless if my "" angry answer"" was impolite.
English isn't my first language, so  I might have gotten your initial answer completely wrong

There are interviews with Stefanie Meyers where Nessie is discussed. The information would be straight from the source and more accurate anyway.   I never said the questions are silly, but the answer to Nessie's rapid growth is obviously stated in both the books and movies. The simple answer is that she's half vamp. You can add hypothesis as to how it all works with the DNA, genetics, and etc. But ultimately, its a fictional world and it was one created by Meyers.",CalaLily73

It was a masterpiece from start to finish.

The first time I was with my older sister and I most definitely freaked out (she didn't as much, but she also doesn't love the books as much as I do). 
The second time was with my parents and my younger siblings and during that entire fight scene I had to cover my mouth and pretend to look shocked (I would've given it away otherwise) as my mom kept looking at me to find out if it was real or not. 

Now every time I watch the movie I try to find details in the battle I may have missed the first time, like the Romanians killing the wives after they killed Marcus.",RedOnTheHead_91
1iqbmbs,Husband watching Breaking Dawn 2 for the first time tonight,md8x3ae,2025-02-17 13:55:15,"We finally watched it üòÅ
When THE scene started he was like ‚Äûno way, what the f*?‚Äù It was so fun seeing him so shocked üòÖat moments he looked at me to see my reactions so I did all my best to look sad and I think it worked become he was devastated at one point, or reacting to Jane and Aro ‚Äûyes get that b*tch‚Äù üòÇ and then after the scene ‚ÄûI knew something was wrong‚Äù. And he is still talking about the movie and whole series today, so it was a success! 
We discussed how he never thought of watching them because he was under impression that they are very bad, from how everyone mocked them and that this is at best a movie for stupid teenagers to fall in love. What he thinks now is that it is the kind of movie which there should be more of, great entertainment- some action, some romance, some comedy, and the fact that the series grew up with the audience. Of course it has its flaws but it is still a great entertainment and the fact that we still talk about them, people can talk shit but they do talk and this is a proof of its greatness for me ü•∞",Agnessa1765

My mom was watching it while I was doing something else. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the movie. But I did perk up for the fight scene. I had no idea who any of the characters were or who the good guys vs the bad guys were. So I was cheering and getting excited for every death that happened. My mom was about ready to murder me when I cheered about Jasper‚Äôs death lol.

Unfortunately, that meant that I knew about the fight scene and that it was a vision when I actually got around to watching the series. I never got to experience the shock of the deaths after getting attached to the characters because I knew it wasn‚Äôt actually happening.",muaddict071537

Jacob stripping in front of Charlie and Charlie‚Äôs reaction to that will never not be hilarious to me.

Yessssss, we watched the entire Twilight Saga. I‚Äôm from Melbourne, Australia btw. There were 3 Twilight Saga marathons running on Saturday with about 300 people each. Our session started at 9:00pm and finished around 8:00am the next morning. There were 10 minute breaks between each movie but between the Breaking Dawn films we had a 30 minute break. They had a Breaking Dawn Breakfast Bar which was open between Breaking Dawn Parts 1 and 2. The marathon started with a Twilight Saga quote off lol. About 6 people volunteered. The winner received a ‚ÄúThis Is The Skin Of A Killer, Bella‚Äù meme t-shirt. Winning quote was ‚ÄúFrom now on I'm Switzerland, okay?‚Äù. üò≠ I was emotional throughout the marathon but especially during the last movie.

Even now 8/9 years after reading the books I feel like that is that part that best aged. Im 16 now qnd I sometimes find myself exasperated with how toxic Edward and Bella can be and how codependent she is. Jacob is like a breath of fresh air.
He's dry and sarcastic and we can see that he has she own assumptions and preconceptions about the Cullens but in the books we see him starting to think they are not that bad (Like in the chapter ""You know something is wrong when u feel guilty about being rude with bloodsuckers""). 
His pov brings humor to a awful situation that no other person would bring. If it was in Bella's pov the book would spend too much time with Bella gushing about the wonders of pregnancy. And Edward hates the whole situation and the readers would probably turn against him if reading his pov. (I mean, he obviously hates the baby b4 Renesme is born and he admits that if not for rosalind he would have gotten rid of it against Bella's wishes). Jacob is the character who brings in the wolfs and who is bitter and hates the situation but also has his things to deal with and makes sure Bella is the most important.

But I don't like the fact that the book that was meant to wrap up the main series was not about the main characters. Twilight through Eclipse was Meyer's work of art. Breaking Dawn is what happens when you have publishers & movie producers breathing down your neck. BD was like one of those bad backdoor pilots. For those who don't know what that means: a backdoor pilot is an episode of a TV show where the plot isn't about the main characters of said TV show. It's an attempt by the network to introduce new characters or elevate existing characters & introduce a new plot in hopes the network can create a new show & earn more $$$. That's what BD was. 

BD should have had Edward's POV, but didn't because that would ruin the appeal & suspense for Midnight Sun. Frankly, the entire concept of Renesme, Jacob & them as a couple should have been saved for a 5th book. Edward & Bella's story doesn't feel complete, partly because the tension with the Volturi is still there lingering in the background. Now we know Meyer only intends to write from Renesme's POV if she writes another book. If Meyer is smart, she would do 3rd person so we could get everyone's perspective. But (and I never wish to insult her or any writer) Meyer seems to act like 3rd person pov doesn't exist. It does. And BD would have been better in 3rd person.

That's a lot for a 16yo go through in the span of a year. I feel like a lot of people find characters annoying forget that those characters tend to be young and have gone through a lot of trauma.

My thoughts on Jacob's PoV is mostly unrelated to his character, but about that I still feel like he was an incredible character in New Moon, and while I have issues with his development in later books the larger issue is that other characters change in response to him which displays obvious favoritism by SM.
The best example for me is Rosalie, how on earth does her character just let him throw food in her hair and not attempt to do anything about it? Rosalie definitely would have, but SM had to make Jacob look tough.",

I feel like I'm too used to Twilight being in first person. Even the little extras from other POVs (Rosalie POV in New Moon, for example, and Jacob POV epilogue in Eclipse) were in first person. Stephenie Meyer definitely can write third person, though. The Chemist is in third person. She does seem to have more of an affinity for first person, and I feel like that works for her books.

It's been a long time, but I'm pretty sure in the books when Jacob told Bella that his friend imprinted on a little kid and was explaining it all he said that basically it just means that we will be there for her no matter what and he will be whatever she needs him to be at the time.. meaning while she's a kid he's just there and a sort of guardian, but I think it was like supposed to be known that eventually they would marry bc you ONLY imprint on your soulmate.
