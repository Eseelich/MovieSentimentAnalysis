That said the next two films are quite good.

Edit: to add onto this, Jack Sparrow in the first film felt like his kooky drunkard side was somewhat a facade to hide his actual intellect, skills and intentions. In the later films it felt more and more like he really was a bizarrely resourceful yet bumbling buffoon.",SpergEmperor

A major point he brought up was that it's one of the last few ""adventure"" movies. There is no catastrophic or world ending event, no master plan, just a grudge between pirates. 

Fun fact, the record holder for highest budget movie is Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. ",Mnkeyqt

The biggest complaint levied at it was that it was convoluted and too much back and forth stabbery. I like that part. It's hilarious. And I think most of the characters are in on it for the most part, because they're all pirates and Beckett is their common enemy.

I think almost all the jokes land, all the action is exciting, different and serves a purpose, the lore about the Locker and afterlife and the Dutchman was compelling and tied directly into the characters.

The character has degenerated over time, and that ruins the fun of the movies for me.  In the last one, he was just a drunk along for the ride.

The first is just such a perfect blend of dramatic action and tongue-in-cheek nonsense, and all the characters feel unique and play an interesting part in the movie. 

Dead Man's Chest loses a little of the charm as it feels a little too 'sequel-ly'; the action is probably the best of the series but as a result they sacrifice some of the individuality of the characters to make them all swashbuckling badasses (see Elizabeth) but all the Davy Jones stuff is just phenomenal. 

At World's End is probably my least favourite of the three but I don't think it deserves half the hate it gets. I'll say it's slow to get going, it's cheesy as hell at parts, and it introduces way too much lore in a single movie but beyond that everything's pretty awesome. I find the plot itself to be the most interesting and layered of all the films, and the often lamented backstabbing just adds to the fun and twists the narrative in some pretty neat directions. And that final battle is undeniably a sight to behold.

There seems to be a perception the Curse Of The Black Pearl is an A grade blockbuster and the other two are just shameless cash-ins. But while they don't quite match up to it's greatness, the other two are still exceptional action films.",TheOncomingBrows

I agree it's a perfect film. Maybe I'm nostalgic but it does feel like movies aren't made like the first pirates anymore. 

It just feels like it doesn't try anything other than try to be a fun & adventurous movie.

Nothing they introduced broke any of the story from the previous movies--it instead built up the narrative to the peak it could go two. 

Same goes for the characters, who were still at core the people we met in Curse, but with enough evolution for their decisions to still make sense.Sparrow as a character still had integrity, and this was before he was written into self-parody in the godawful last one.

Lastly, and most importantly, Johnny Depp still cared about the work he was doing with those movies--an aspect that has severely deteriorated since then.",BellyCrawler
8e3jd1,"Having watched the first three 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films again after not having seen them in years, I think they don't get enough credit.",dxsgar8,2018-04-22 18:41:54,"To be honest, the true issue with the Franchise is that they sort of forgot what it was all about.

Think back to the reveal in *Black Pearl* about the undead curse. It was this huge ""ta-da!"" that completely caused the movie to pivot. What started out as a clever swashbuckling movie with pirates, damsels, and a Royal Navy, suddenly changes into a story about mythical curses, and the undead!

*Dead Man's Chest* opens with things ""back to normal."" With familiar characters of Will & Elizabeth and Port Royal. The plot begins with Will & Elizabeth being blackmailed to find Jack Sparrow. We see pirate bars, and pirates and Royal Navies! And again, the movie pivots with Davy Jones! But he isn't just some pirate! He is a sea monster! And he has THE KRACKEN! The whole mythology just busts open! The Flying Dutchman is now some sort of magical place with even more interesting characters too!

*At World's End* opens up still amid what was happening in *Dead Man's Chest*. If anything, it feels like the same movie, but that isn't a bad thing. We are back in the driver's seat with Will, Elizabeth, Jack, and everybody else. By the end we have gone full circle. We have met tons of cool characters., been introduced to tons of mythos and codes. The story has met it's natural conclusion; boy wins girl, heroic trio saves the day, the main characters have gone through real development and growth, the monster is defeated, and the wily Jack skirts off to have so many unbelievable adventures! (Sea Turtles, mate.)

But the fourth movie, *On Stranger Tides*, we open to just Jack on his own. We dive right into unfamiliar places, with unfamiliar faces. We are given almost no time to care about any plot. The writers banked on people loving Johnny Depp as Jack, and Barbosa & his monkey to be enough ""nostalgia"" for us. And, it just doesn't work. 

Now, what is worse is that Disney knows *Stranger Tides* wasn't well received. But rather than examine why and fix it, they attempt to rehash the same concepts that worked before (Heroic Trio, Evil Monster Captain with a Magic Boat, Some Artifacts, and a Curse), and just hoped we would come back. 

At this point, The Franchise is just that, a franchise. Maybe someone will come along with an interesting tale in that universe. I hope so.

Jack randomly starts asking people to *pay him* for saving him. This is completely new for him. And it's all explained as his back story. That's great for a standalone character, I guess. But for a character *in movie fucking FIVE*?!

Not to mention that it goes against the grain of what Jack was in the first movie. Many people don't know about Jack's past, as set out in the first movie, and almost completely revealed by a deleted scene from the first movie.

Jack Sparrow was a privateer. He decided to sail under the command of The East Empire Trading Company, for none other than Cutler Becket, one of the main antagonists of the first movie.

Jack Sparrow, a law-abiding sailor, was transporting slaves on behalf of Cutler Becket and TEETC but had a change of heart and liberated them.

He liberated a hundred slaves. Remember that number.

For liberating the slaves, he was branded a pirate (quite literally, as seen on his wrist, by Cutler Becket), and his ship The Wicked Wench, was burned and sunk to the bottom of the ocean.

Jack, now branded a pirate, Did Some Stuff™, and then went to meet with Davy Jones. Davy Jones agreed to resurrect the Wicked Wench from the depths for the price of Jack's soul eternally at the helm of the Flying Dutchman when he was done.

And then Barbosa mutinied and Jack lost the pearl.

This is referenced in a sly way later on, in Dead Man's Chest, when Davy Jones requests 'a hundred souls' in exchange for Jack's freedom from his debt.

And all of this is referenced in a deleted scene with Jack Sparrow and Cutler Beckett talking and Jack says 'People aren't cargo, mate'.

And then.

Movie five.

Nah he was just always a pirate. Got his command by smashing up Salazar. All that crap with the Wicked Wench/Pearl, all of that. Just nah. Throw that all away!

POTC are incredible as a trilogy. But four and five just ruined it by trying to be too quirky and change established backstories.

I love the first three to death. But after that, it went too far. It strayed too much. It tried to add shit to characters that didn't need adding to.

It really is in a league of its own thanks to fantastic storytelling and how well it handled its horror/adventure elements. Dead Man's Chest is quite good, extremely fun and enjoyable (love that cannibal island opening, the Kraken, the three-way sword fight, etc.) and expanded the universe in awesome ways (Davy Jones is imo the best-looking CGI character ever thanks both to creature design and amazing effects), but by the third, the script had grown into a convoluted mess. Having said that, At World's End is still an enjoyable flick, I like all the POTC movies (even 4 and 5 to a lesser degree...though Jack's deterioration as a character is more evident than ever in that last one) but LOVE 1 and hold 2 above 3 4 and 5.

I’ve been a PotC fan since it was announced. I love these movies, and I agree that the first one is a perfect film. 

They lost the original spark chasing the money with the last two (of the trilogy), it felt like to me. The original was so great because it toed the line between reality and fantasy. It wasn’t bang you over the head with fantasy plot and elements- it was a smattering of fantasy in a swashbuckling character movie. It was a love story and a comedy. It was a historical film and a fantasy movie. It dealt with the dark and with the light. You could believe that the entire plot happened in real life, and no one would have been the wiser. It brought back pirates in a pirate dead market. 

Jack Sparrow was a phenomenal character, as evidenced by his explosion in popularity. Because he was so grey. He was dirty and ruthless, you never fully understood if he was madness or genius, yet in the end he always landed on the side of the “good guys”. He won even if he played dirty. You could root for him even if he did a few bad things. Throughout the rest of the movies after the original one, he slowly turned into a overblown stereotype of himself. They thought CotBP was so successful because of Jack, but it was really the entire movie all together that made it so wonderful. 

4 and 5 it clearly became “the jack sparrow show”. The original trilogy is great, like you said, and I enjoy watching them every once in a while. But the first one is just fantastic and if they had stopped there I would have been completely satisfied. After the first movie, there are plot holes that don’t make sense, scenes that are obvious fan service, jokes that fall flat, and plot lines that make you either roll your eyes or wonder if you’re dreaming.

I never expected the first one to be any good until I saw it on DVD about a year later and realized how good it was, and I saw all of the subsequent films in theaters.

That includes 4 and 5, incidentally, even if those weren't as good. I think it might have been best to keep it at 3... and yet I still found myself buying tickets. 4 was more interesting than I think it gets credit for. It works mostly as a standalone, like the original, and it had some interesting character choices, but it suffered from being adapted from a pre-existing source, and most of the new characters lacked the personality of the ones we'd met in previous films. I felt Blackbeard was good, though, owing largely to Ian McShane's performance.

5, well... I sort of just wanted a night out, really. It was probably slightly more entertaining than 4 overall, but more of the same. If you've seen any previous POTC film, you know almost exactly what to expect from this one. Still, it at least resolved some character arcs.

I keep watching these movies mostly out of habit, and to support pirate films in general. Once a booming genre, it was dead for decades until POTC came along. I'm not sure if there's a way to do it better than what this franchise did, but I'd at least like others to try.",PercyHavok

The next two are OK. I've not seen the last two because they looked like they were trying to get blood from a stone. 

I can't stand the character of Elizabeth Swann. I hate how she put her pirate fantasy/obsession ahead of just about everything else. I hate how she gets turned up to eleven without any real explanation of how she gets from lady who can't breathe in a corset to total badass. Every decision she makes is the ""correct"" one and she never has to make any sacrifices. She gets everything she wants in the end. Will Turner starts off ok but is eventually sucked in to this writing as well.

Everyone goes on about Jack Sparrow and I liked him in the first three, so that's all I'll say about him.  

The character I really liked (and who I think gets overlooked) was Norrington. He's Will's love-rival to Elizabeth and could have been set up as unlikeable as is usually done. Instead he is portrayed as a good, honorable man who is hyper competent and who unselfishly puts everyone else's interests ahead of his own (a trait which ultimately gets him dishonored and killed). He's a foil not only to Jack Sparrow but to Elizabeth Swann in this way.

He actually has a nice character arc where he actually experiences plausible growth and changes. He is an incredibly conflicted character by the second movie and into the third, having fallen from Grace, and while he's never truly able to recapture who he was before, he's also no longer lost in life. He's able to reclaim ownership of his principles and behave honorably, even if his concept of ""honor"" has evolved.

And then they killed him off in probably the stupidest way possible. Yes, it's 2018 and I'm still upset about it. Here's the best swordsman in the cast and he gets one-shotted by a shambling, demented zombie. Here's the only truly ""good guy"" and he doesn't get a happy ending. There was so much more that could have been done with Norrington, especially with how he and Sparrow just *gel*... But he got the stabby death and literally everyone forgot about him and his sacrifice. It was a huge disappointment for me.

At World’s end is my favorite of the bunch, mostly because I think the writing is the most subtle, creative, and emotional of all of the films. Particular highlights include Elizabeth’s “Hoist the Colours” speech and the parlay sequence just before it. If you ever watch it again, pay attention to the nonverbal exchanges during the parlay, and watch as Will, Jack, and Elizabeth all gradually end up on the same page of the plan, while Barbossa ends up left out. From that perspective, Elizabeth’s speech ends up almost entirely intended for Barbossa’s benefit, to motivate him back into the fight by using some of his own words for inspiration.

Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, etc. Last week we watched the first three Pirates movies. I hadn't seen them in years; the first one being the only one I'd seen more than twice.

I always liked the trilogy, more so than most people, who seem to be rather critical of part 2 and 3. Having seen them again, I can definitely see where the criticism is coming from. The first one was a near flawless adventure movie, very much in the vein of a Indiana Jones film. Part 2 and 3 in comparison are rather filled with too much exposition, characters with motives and goals and generally just too much 'stuff'. Constantly thinking about what event means what for which character gets in the way of enjoying the film and ends up being a bit tiring, which I could see on my sisters reaction, but also on my own. We still ended up enjoying part 2 and 3.

But there is one thing I really admire about the Pirates movies. Considering that the first movie was born out of a theme park ride, an idea so corporate and eye-roll-inducing, those movies really had no fucking right to feature such incredibly creative, fun and awesome world-building and sense of time and place.

At Worlds End May have been a bit of a mess narratively, but damn the visuals, the action, the cinematography, the drama, the humor, and especially the MUSIC (still one of my favorite Hans Zimmer scores to this day) made me incredibly satisfied and I would’ve been ok had they left it there and not gone on to make part 4 (abysmal) and 5 (mildly entertaining but ultimately unnecessary). At World’s End is why I’m hoping Disney will let the next Avengers (Avengers 4) be close to 3 hours because I personally (IMHO IMHO IMHO) believe it worked for Pirates 3",PrinceNuada01

The third one is also awesome. Pretty much a continuation of the second.

The fourth one, most people don’t like, though I thought it did really well and was fun while keeping most of Jack’s character there.

I despise the fifth one. Aside from the multiple plot holes in it, Jack’s character is DUMB STUPID DRUNK. Every other film he’s been cleverly witty-tipsy. The entirety of the fifth one I hated Jack. It wasn’t until the last scene when he is sailing away that he goes back to his normal self that I like him but at this point, the movies over lol. Granted, this has me excited for the sixth installment since I’m assuming Will Turner will be in it and Davy Jones is back, whom is a character I love as a villain.

The scene at the bell tower and the scene with the water wheel rolling down the hill are by far my favorite scenes in all of the movies, just because of how intense it is (even with goofy Jack getting stuck in it) because everybody’s trying to get the key and they all keep getting sidetracked fighting one another, and the key keeps switching possessions. AND because of the music, which personally is my favorite musical score of any major blockbuster movie/franchise. Apart from the plot and all that, the character design alone is astounding.

It's a movie where every shot, every sound, and every line of dialogue has a purpose. Either advancing the story, or developing the characters. Everything in the film is crafted to execute, and that's why it works so well.  
I compare it to *A New Hope* in that way. They were both fairly simple stories; with a few twists and turns, action, drama, and comedy, some fun mystical elements, and purpose-driven special effects to tie it all together.

* The Matrix Trilogy
* Spider-Man 1 & 2

I could go on and on about movies that more notable between 2003-2007, maybe even giving a few extra years as buffer.

I would also say Back to the Future is a perfect film. A tight script, many setups and payoffs (in BttF EVERY setup has a payoff) with good dialogue, it's well filmed, well paced, great characters... a perfect film. I wouldn't change a thing. 

What a great analysis man. Dead man's chest did capture the imagination. World's End did just up the extremity of most everything. I would say it's the beginning of the end of REAL Jack Sparrow, though, because he started becoming a caricature of himself. Black Pearl Jack was a swashbuckling pirate on the loose, fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants side. But he wasn't an idiot or loon. In Dead Man's chest he was similar but consumed with fear and self interest, still Jack but the situation pushed his personality. World's End Jack is still Jack but all the stuff going on is ridiculous. But at this point, Johnny Depp decided that this was normal Jack. So for the next two films, Jack is a bit too much.

5 I saw in theaters and it made me sad. Like Pirates of the Caribbean to me is that moment when you're in the boat going past the guy playing banjo, there's a mist on the water... you enter this dim tunnel and behold! A skull speaking to you! As a kid that looked real as life and it scared the hell outta me. The first half of the ride is eery and spooky, then it lightens up. But the excitement and mystery is the first part. Curse of the Black Pearl captured that. There was a good bit of that in 4 even, moreso than 3. But Pirates 5? The greatest offense to me, which is indicative of the whole movie, is the background of the end credits. It looks like a happy screensaver! It looked cheap, bright, and thrown together. 

That's my biggest gripe with 5. I mean Javier Bardem seemed to get it with his character, but the mystery and the magic was just absent from the rest of the movie. ",None

You are completely taken by the action, I don't know about you but that never happens with modern blockbusters like the avengers. The third one finally offers the ending of all the numerous interests which grew on each character through previous movies (the staring game when they meet on the small island before the big fight while epic morricone's music is playing says it all).

The third one is the best in terms of everything except jack sparrow., and one of my favorite movies. The mythos and complications of jacks background are very well done. Easy to handle and they make sense for the character but jack himself just hasn't done it for me in some time, probably not since the 2nd movie.  The 5th one saw a return to a style most comparable to the 2nd movie which was a good sign.  At world's end proposed a theme that I wish the further movies had kept going with, ""Who is Jack Sparrow?""

I especially loved how the Kracken would show up several times, but each time it would be shown just a bit more, creating a sense of urgency and while the Kracken is attacking everything in the sea, our characters are trying to figure out what it is and what Davy Jones is! I think it does a wonderful job of creating a unique spin on a fairly overdone setting (pirates) and creates a dark yet comedic world of sea monsters, undead demons and gods",Binch101

I just think Depps personal issues and his turning out to be such a monumental asshole has ruined future PotC films for me.

I have long thought Crystal Skull was a much better film than people give it credit for.

Another weird thing is people complaining about there being too much physical comedy and ""quipping"" in modern franchise/action movies, which I just find odd considering some of the most quoted moments of classic action films like Terminator 2 and Die Hard were played for laughs.  To me, a franchise film is successful if I feel a few different emotions throughout but ultimately come out smiling.  Kind of like a theme park.

The next two movies lean into that aspect so hard that right from the start I wasn’t into it.

Once they went with magic, the tension and stakes are all out the window. You can kill main characters with zero consequences as they do with Sparrow, and basically just pull out any nonsense you want to overcome the circumstances you invent.

It's dir. Gore Verbinsky at his best and the whole is done at the height of HW's fantasy renaissance, as it were. There are quite a *few* adaptations out there that deserve the genre related to 'epic romances' and both LOTR, the HP adaptations, and Pirates did that. As far as fantasy franchises go, it's still a wonderful benchmark that even its own later entries can't top. We were arguing on r/Fantasy about how the quality of 'epic fantasy' films declined because at least in the 2000s the decade had a pop-culture that existed in the shadows of 9/11 and Gulf War 2. The epic war genre can thrive in that sort of imagination, the first three Pirates films are an example -- all about the 'pirate subculture' at war. If this was made in the 1990s it'd just stop short of simply being ABOUT the pirate subculture, minus the grand stakes and military backdrop. In the 2010s, the shift in the popular imaginations has been from 'war' to 'alternate realities' (the internet and digital technology has sort of made 'other realities' more ubiquitious in this decade than it did in the last) and it's unfortunate that the pirates franchise hasn't quite managed to capture that essence as of yet. Though not for lack of trying. Any cinematic 'universe' will attest to that. Jack Sparrow bringing up the need for anonymity and other Robinsonades about the #MeToo movement? A pirate prime minister ? I know people dislike Kiera Knightley but I thought she was a very important part of the cast that made the plot compelling.

I found the pacing, especially in the first half, to be all over the place. When I reached the 1 hour mark, it felt like the actual plot was just getting started despite being almost halfway through the running time, and found myself very disappointed that the ending of the film didn't conclude the story in a satisfactory way. It felt to me that they were trying to make an ""Empire Strikes Back"" type of sequel where the cast is at their lowest point by the end, and the audience is supposed to think ""oh boy, how will our heroes get out of this pickle"" before a glimmer of hope appears. However, to me it felt slightly disingenuous, like more of a ""to be continued"" instead of setting up interesting events to come.

Additionally, I was hoping for more from the sailor mythology aspect of the world, the scenes about Davy Jones' heart and the key, where they were picking apart the legend to find the truth is very interesting to me, but I ended up having more questions then there were answers. Elements like ""Why do they turn into sea creatures"" or ""where did the kracken come from, and why does he have control over it"" were left completely up in the air. I understand that not fully understanding a supernatural thing makes it more fascinating, but to only answer some of those questions and not others felt more like they were padding content for the third installment.

My personal favorite is At World's End, it makes me sad people don't like it very much. I think it's really misunderstood.

I think in all of those Jack was still the same, endearing pirate. obviously, with new stories and side plots, you get to see new layers, but the first three were still absolutely great. but I'm biased because I absolutely adore the trilogy, and again the third one is my favorite. I might also add that it was a but ahead of its time with the great, strong female characters (interestingly 3/5 female characters that had a more significant role, were POC) Anyway, nice to see people give some attention to PotC.

My younger brother became obsessed with the series last year and as a result I ended up rewatching the films for the first time in years, and I found myself enjoying the a lot more than I initially did.

I think this is mostly due to the number of interwoven subplots being difficult to track unless done in successive viewing.

That being said, it still doesn't forgive it for having a weak villain in Beckett or the Calypso subplot that seems to just end.",SPZ_Ireland

In many ways it's even better than the critic darlings that are the Lords of the Rings. It was harmed in terms of reviews by being based on a theme park ride instead of a respected literary work, but it has a freshness that nothing else from its time really matches. Also, nobody mentions this, but the choreography of the action scenes is fucking great. Compare the cgi heaviness and shoddy editing of the Cave Troll fight in Fellowship with the elegance of Jack's fight with Will in Curse of the Black Pearl.

The second is a mess of a script, but has probably the most iconic imagery in the series. Truth is I don't even care that the entire Pelegostos scene weights the plot down, since the tradeoff is one of the best action setpieces ever.

In the opinion the main problem with the third, more than the increasingly convoluted plot and flanderization of Jack's character, is that the massive sense of scale and high stakes \(that reading other comments here apparently some people loved, but not me\) absolutely does not fit the franchise. The Brethren Court is a terrible idea that  forces the freedom loving characters of Jack and Barbossa into the role of semi\-bureaucrats,  the new ultra complex lore doesn't fit tonally with the careless, easy going essence of being a pirate as we see it the first movie. Trying to give a bigger ""meaning"" to everything \(even Ragetti's wooden eye, damn it\) makes the movie feel too self\-important and robs the franchise of its fundamental pleasure, which was the basic fun of just going on an pirate adventure. Ironically it tried too much to be like LoTR and was harmed by that, becoming sort of a weird tonal hybrid of the two franchises.",UnderwaterSharkFight

It was all why the franchise sucks since number 4, not caring whether 5 did the same thing, addressed those issues, did them better or even caring if it was a good and entertaining film.   
It was a franchise many had already given up on and they had firm views in their head as to why.    
It'll be a real shame if they don't get to make another sequel, 5 was really good. They got back on the right track.",LaxSagacity

I'm sorry, if somebody made me that offer, I'd take it right now. If I only have to see him one day every ten years, sign me up, because I don't think I can stand another moment of sitting there in the cinema, watching this dribblesome bore waltz around like somebody out of a Milk Tray advert.

In the 3rd movie he's reduced (OUT of nowhere) to just a guy horny for the Super-woman-voodoo chick; what could have been a Faust-esque battle of wits between pirates and Satan (the deceivest humans vs the deceivest entity), was shrunk down to a super-villain battle. Meh.

The second and third were good, the problem is that they just couldn't compare to the first film. POTC 1 was one of those movies that just gets it all right, every single thing right in my opinion

Since 2 and 3 weren't as good as 1 they get a bad rap, and probably looked at harsher than they deserve. Some of the criticism is warranted, the films for example do get worse as they go on IMO

But all in all this is very similar to similar series. To make a slightly random comparison with another Disney franchise, Lion King. Lion King 1 is another example of a nigh on perfect film, and I feel both Lion King 2 and Lion King 1½ get undue criticism as a result (plus being Disney direct-to-dvd sequels doesn't help).

First Film: Obviously great; It brought back that feeling I had in watching the original Star Wars films. It was just an adventure film that was done really well. It was a movie that didn't need a lot of surprises, just to invest you along the way so that the plot points felt earned. I think this is something Hollywood is forgetting. Surprises for the sake of surprises aren't satisfying. 

Second Film: I actually loved the second one at first, and I think most people initially did too, but it was one of those movies that got more hate the more it sat. The set pieces and scope of that movie, especially with the Kracken scenes are amazing. The introduction of Davy Jones, made for a wonderful character intro that was built up so much that he easily could have disappointed, but didn't. Still, I remember immediately feeling like all the story points they put out, were becoming too many, and it was going to be difficult to wrap it up by the third film in a way that was both satisfying and well earned. That film's ultimate judgement was always going to be based on how well the third one wrapped up it's (second film's) Story elements, and I think the hollow feeling from third, left the second one in a kind of purgatory, that's difficult to be judged on its own merits

Third Film: While I didn't hate it, it was the most disappointing for me. That said, I think that it was somewhat the fault of the second movie for introducing too many different story elements and moving parts like I previously mentioned. Not only did they have to wrap those up, but they introduced even MORE of those type of things. All that considered, they at least found ways to wrap up everything in ways that made sense. It just got to be too much. Though still a better movie, it suffered from the same problem as spider man 3 in that there were too many story threads that were put out, for any of their resolutions to feel earned, and meaningful. I still cared about what happened to the characters because of the threads from the previous films, but their arcs within that film, felt too rushed, convoluted, and unearned. It's a credit to the film that those arcs were easy enough to keep track of, it's just that too much happened, with too many different elements, for the character plots and motivations within that film to truly have satisfying conclusions. Decent conclusions sure, but ultimately hollow. Also, they became too reliant on ""twists."" Like I said about the first movie, a good adventure movie doesn't need to have surprises just for the sake of them. Predictable plot points that are earned through evoking emotion, is far better than a ""twist"" that doesn't grow out of a Character motivation that I'm very invested in. Investing in those character motivations takes time, time that the third movie was unable to allow for, making all those twists seem actually kind of boring because of the sheer overload of them.

I do think part of the lost luster is just the inherent nature of the where they went with the story.  So much of the excitement and love of pirates and that era of seafaring is about mystery and the romance of open possibilities.

That is possible because the film isn't ostensibly about Jack but Johnny Depp takes every opportunity to ham it up and steal scenes, and the editing and directing is good enough that not only does it not ruin anything but the Jack part becomes this bit of clowning chaos that is always exciting/fresh for the audience.

The issue with in the next two films is that they pull focus and make Jack's mythology the focus. That in and of itself is fine because Will and Elizabeth don't really have sufficient back story you could use to fashion more episodes from. But once Jack is the focus Johnny Depp no longer has the room to upstage the other players, he is already the focus, so there's no limelight to steal. Hamming it up more is no longer adding anything, the audience already get it so there's no need to lay it on as thick.

Only to find that the swords are stuck to their display case and she can’t get them free, and ends up having to hide. 

That kind of showed her character. She is brave and clever. But not a fighter. She thought her way out of her problems. Convincing the pirates to parlay. Burning the rum as a signal. The whole ghost woman thing in the second one fits, too. But having her become a badass with a sword kind of ruined her character for me. 

Not because a woman can’t fight pirates, but because it’s such a lazy solution to solving her problems. She should have managed to become a pirate lord without ever actually knowing how to swing a sword. ",kung-fu_hippy

Lots of movies don't take themselves seriously nowadays. I would even argue that the number is actually far higher than back when Black Pearl released, because of the huge success of superhero movies since. Pretty much all franchises don't nowadays, including Marvel, DC, Mission Impossible, Jurassic World, Star Wars, etc.

However, I do agree with you in a sense. The comedy in the Black Pearl just works so well in a way that it doesn't in blockbusters nowadays, the newest PotC movie included. The comedy is just sort of crammed in there to ensure forced levity. It makes it so that any dramatic moments feel like they have no weight to them. I like the Black Pearl not because it knew when *not* to take itself seriously, but because it knew when it *should*. The comedy works AND the dramatic moments also work in that movie.",Karlzone

Agreed. This is perfectly cemented by how they treated the Jack Sparrow character. You all know what I mean. He went from so clever and insane, that the audience questions whether he's just insane or incredibly clever or both, to comedic relief. The fact that he controls the plot and the catalyst for the events unfolding while the audience and the other characters figure this out is what made that character brilliant. Disney failed to figure that out, and assumed it's because of the wacky hi-jinks and his goofy mannerisms alone.

> At this point, The Franchise is just that, a franchise. Maybe someone will come along with an interesting tale in that universe. I hope so.

The only way they pull it off is if the original creators have a proper story to tell or another talented crew has a brilliant idea for the universe. It will never work if Disney puts the cart before the horse; lays out a release date and tells whoever they hire to rush to meet that deadline.

A good example is The Big Bang Theory, which could be renamed the Sheldon show. They discovered one character polled as more popular than the rest so they made him more prominent and extreme but ended up ruining the balance. 

This also happens with directors. When the Hateful Eight came out I was nervous, because I knew Tarantino had become popular enough and had made enough movies that he was at risk of being less creative, and more focused on what he knew historically worked and made him popular. Sure enough, although a good movie, it was my least favorite of his, and again felt like a caricature version of his other films.

Originally he was designed as more of a bugs bunny type character (clever, loveable jerk, able to one up an authority figure etc) it was Johnny Depp who figured that pirates were like the rockstars of their time and based Jack on the most piratey rockstar he could think of - Keith Richards (hence the multiple cameos) and through that portrayed him as a staggering drunk. (thanks dvd commentary) 
I think because of this, the writers didn't write Jack in the sequels Like he was originally conceived, but as he was ultimately portrayed, loosing some of what made him so fun in the original.
Fun fact: the script was based off of another script that writers had been working on for some time. A Monkey Island movie. Which really explains alot when you think about it
Additional fun fact: Monkey Island was based/inspired off of the novel ""on stranger tides"" so the film series kind of came around full circle. ",paggo_diablo

If they wanted him to be more bumbling and more ridiculous in the later films, they could have written into the story that when a pirate receives the black spot from Davy Jones, it makes him delirious and less intelligent, etc., which makes him easier to find and catch/kill. That way they could have had a bumbling Jack Sparrow for some of the later movies and then had him come back into his full on clever ways towards the end of the story.

DP should, by all accounts, be a supporting character in the X-Men MOVIES (i read the comics, I know he's got his own books so that doesn't matter) but the point is that in X-Men Origins he's comic-relief.

I was talking about At World's End. Curse is included in the qualifier ""since Lion King"", because it came before the third movie, shockingly.

A lot of people say that in the second and third one he becomes a bloated caricature of himself, but I don’t think so at all (although he kind of is in the 4th one and COMPLETELY is in the 5th one). Throughout Dead Mans chest, jack is manipulating everyone and scheming to accomplish his own ends, just like in the first one. The difference in this one is the characters are more daring and assertive when it comes to dealing with him (The whole fight for the key is the perfect example not to mention IMO one of the greatest adventure/action sequences ever). Same with the third when he strikes his deal with Beckett, or battles Jones for the chest, or steals the map from Barbossa. I love the fact that none of the characters have some real unspoken bond (for the most part) because they are pirates after all. Like in the Chest when they’re trying to escape the cannibals and each cage with the crew is racing to the Pearl, perfectly content to leave the others behind. Or when Will is content to let Norrington kill Jack, or when Elizabeth and the two pirate guys (I forget their names) are about to fight, but are suddenly on each others side when the Dutchman crew shows up. God just writing about it makes me realize how much I love these movies. Point is Jack is consistent in the OG trilogy, he just is a little less subtle with his humor in the 2nd and 3rd.

I would even argue that the number is actually far higher than back when Black Pearl released, because of the huge success of superhero movies since. Pretty much all franchises don't nowadays, including Marvel, DC, Mission Impossible, Jurassic World, Star Wars, etc.

I agree with you. But those movies still feel very different. I agree with you that the comedy feels crammed in there, forced at times and then they try to be serious the next minute. Take the pacman moment from GOTG2 or the dance moment in the last fight in GOTG1. I never liked GOTG much personally. I feel like the comedy gets predictable after a while. They're more like Pirates of the Caribean 4+ for me.  As in the latter Pirates films Jack Sparrow becomes a bit too much. They sacrifice his serious side for more ""comedic moments"". 

This reminds me as well of when I compare The Office US to Brooklyn Nine Nine. The Office was ridiculous at times but the character still had a real and serious side. While Brooklyn Nine Nine sacrifices the serious and realistic side of characters, to create more comedic moments. The issue is that it's just cheap jokes in the end and gets old real quick. While The Office US could still maintain a coherent narrative with realistic characters while still being fun.

Firstly, the EITC was a trade cartel that ""pirated"" ships themselves and toppled governments and set up colonies in the name of profit. Imagine the most ruthless company you know, with navies and armies to back them up in anything they wanted to do.

Second...A large number of pirates were escaped naval sailors. At the time, Britain's navy was not so voluntary. Press gangs would roam the streets, beating people up and kidnapping them to crew ships. You'd wake up at sea and congratulations, you're in the navy.

This is also the reason beer typically comes in glasses nowadays. Recruiting officers would go to bars and buy rounds, and slip a shilling into the bottom. Once you accepted the drink, you ""took the king's shilling"" (your first pay check) and were now in the navy. Glass-bottomed vessels were initially a way to curb this practice.

So this practice often lead to mutiny. And if you mutinied, you were dead if you were ever caught. So crews that rose up against their captors were de facto pirates, having committed murder and hijacked something that was *insanely* expensive, and they had to continue that path to survive. That's the origin of many buccaneers.

Then there were privateers. Governments like those of Britain, France and Spain routinely authorised individuals to plunder ships of rival nationalities, offering a license legitimising it in return for a cut of the goods.",redwall_hp

This is what I mean by understanding the time period and competing interests. The East India Company was a private company by this time period, that had been sanctioned by two governments. The company had become greedy and some what irresponsible, because they were now challenging the very governments who sanctioned them in more than a few places. Keep in mind that at some point pirates worked for the British, French, Dutch and Spanish governments against each other. Then you have the pirates just trying to survive as independents.  

Then comes all the love stories. Will for his father. Will for Elizabeth, Davey for Calypso, in that I hate you so much bitch, that I love you way.

At some point, I believe they realized that Kramer would naturally steal the whole show and started working to make sure that didn't happen.

If we're talking about the original meaning of the word that the ancient Greeks used, it's super simple: the lead actor, the one with the most screen time, is Orlando Bloom. 

If we're talking about it in the more modern sense, in the way that Syd Field, Robert McKee, Blake Snyder, William Goldman, or Steven King have written about the concept, the protagonist is the character that drives the movie's plot forward. 

In the first movie, that character is Will:

Will's inciting incident determines the arc of the film, and the resolution of his storyline is the film's resolution as well. Jack Sparrow is a support character because no matter how important he is to the film (and in a well-written film, every speaking role should be important because why else are they eating precious screen time?) it is not his story. It is Will's. 

I agree that the movie belongs to Jack Sparrow and Johnny Depp. He stole every frame he was dropped into, unquestionably, and that is why he was placed front and center of every movie thereafter. You would be hard-pressed to find anyone who didn't think Johnny Depp was the best part of the movie. That doesn't change the fact that the Jack Sparrow character is, in the first film, a supporting role.

There was even a deleted scene that reveals they hired Jack Sparrow to transport a shipment, and when he discovered the cargo was human slaves he released them. Freeing the slaves is what set Sparrow on the wrong side of the law and led him to piracy. IMO the scene should have been left in precisely to better set up who’s good and who’s bad in *Pirates*.

> There was a goblin, or a trickster, or a warrior. A nameless, terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most feared being in all the cosmos. And nothing could stop it, or hold it, or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world...

The Doctor has built up this reputation of being the most dangerous thing in the universe, but half the time it comes down to dumb luck. Even when he's trying to be a manipulative chessmaster, like in the Sylvester McCoy stories, he often misses something important and has to improvise a new solution.

Some stories, like *The Parting of the Ways* and *The Face of Evil*, also have the Doctor return to places where he's been before, only to find that his previous actions actually ended up leading to even worse oppression than before.

This line from Peter Capaldi's episode *Death in Heaven* sums the Doctor up pretty well, I think. He's spent the whole series questioning if he's been a good man or not, and comes to this conclusion:

> ""I am *not* a good man! I am not a bad man. I am not a hero. And I'm definitely not a president. And no, I'm not an officer. Do you know what I am? I... am... an idiot! With a box and a screwdriver. Just passing through, helping out, learning.""",protomenfan200x

>Regardless about whether a time turner was involved giving him confidence, he still cast that Patronus completely on his own.

Regardless about whether he cast that patronus ""on his own"", a time turner was still involved giving him literally unshakeable confidence, something that would allow nearly *anyone* to cast a patronus. 

In fact, before using the time turner, Harry failed completely to repel the dementors with his patronus on the shore of the lake, showing explicitly that the time turner hack is the reason he could pull it off. “I knew I could do it all this time, because I'd already done it"". If not for the time turner hack he'd be dead. 

>When Ron and Hermione are trying to convince him to lead the DA he says all kinds of things to downplay his abilities. They consider him much more skilled than he considers himself.

Just because they think he's more skilled doesn't mean he is. He doesn't say things to downplay his ability, he explains that he lucked and hacked his way through it, which is the truth. Ron comes to understand this in book 7:

'Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcux. Saving my life.'

I've got a few theories about the various mechanics and consequences of this whole area of magical theory, but 

1) the horcrux-making just locks part of the soul away to use it as an anti-death anchor, it's *murder* that splits the soul, which means Voldemort's soul likely resembles a whole roll of toilet paper separated into individual squares, all flapping around like confused bats or something, and

2) Voldemort started making horcruxes with his first few murders, which means the pieces he locked away in them were a lot bigger fractions of his whole self than any of the later ones. 

In fact, his *first* murder (Moaning Myrtle) got made into his first horcrux (the diary), meaning that there's half of him locked away already. His second horcrux, the ring, was done after he'd just committed three more murders (his father and paternal grandparents), so that was another third or so of the half that was left, and the murder of old Hepzibah Smith in order to horcruxify either the locket or the cup would have been quite likely the next one on.

Assuming that the soul fragment that goes into the horcrux is one-half the freshest, made-for-the-purpose split each time, and assuming that the largest soul fragment present splits with each new murder, he was probably at this point done with the major damage of losing large parts of himself to horcruxes, but the damage of shredding his soul into mass-murder confetti is likely pretty significant as well. These soul fragments would have a *volume* that likely contributed to his consciousness being greater than that of any of the later horcruxes, but I would guess that his consciousness and his connection to reality are, at this point, impressively shattered, and I find it likely that the stray piece that split off with Lily's murder latched onto Harry because it was confused enough to mistake Harry for the rest of itself (perhaps helped by the fact that, after the Killing Curse backfired from Harry, Harry's was the only soul present in the room).

It's also possible that due to that reaction, ONLY the largest fragment that most housed Voldemort's consciousness managed to hang onto that tether and not vanish into the afterlife, or only six or so (whatever number of horcruxes he had made at that point) pieces managed it, each of them grabbing at one of the existing horcruxes to stay on the mortal plane and scrambling his consciousness so much that it took him over a decade to recover even to the point of managing to talk to someone like Quirrell.

Note that Harry is so viscerally repulsed by the soul fragment's representation that he cannot bring himself to touch it, and Dumbledore states with finality that it is beyond help; I'm thinking this was due to more than Voldemort's evilness, but that it is too small and shredded to function as a person on its own, sort of the equivalent of scraping up a pound or so of pulped flesh with a bit of recognizable spleen in it after a bad car accident and trying to restore a living person out of it; with its physical host, it can be an anchor for Voldemort's consciousness, but without that, it is nothing.

But, anyway, point being is, I'm pretty sure the soul fragment inside Harry was nowhere near an eighth.",Cypraea

Plenty of good actors ""play themselves"". Tom Hanks, for example.

But also, go look at Johnny Depp's filmography. Nothing pre-Pirates is anything like Jack Sparrow.

Also, Jack Sparrow in the first movie was much subtler and less zany than subsequent movies.

Agreed that Bloom and Knightly didn't bring anything that dozens of other actors couldn't.",sentimentalpirate

Both first movies are a lot of fun and great to watch within a bubble. The second movie has some impressive sequences but tries to over complicate a lot of things. That being said, they both still have a lot to enjoy due to reasons including but not limited to the initial sequences. The third is where things go off the rails and both the second and third movies even follow similar story beats (ending on a cliffhanger in the second with a returning character that was thought to be dead, although Agent Smith did get a fair amount of screen time in it unlike Barbosa) and both third movies having the first portion of it being dedicated around getting the main character out of their equivalent of limbo.",TJOW40

So he knew *exactly* what to film in order to give his artists the best material to work with, and knew what he wanted out of the effects.

The ""making of"" films for the second and third films are some of the absolute best I've ever seen. There's so much put into those movies, and so many practical effects mixed with absolutely incredible CGI that it's no surprise it holds up to this day.

One example I love is the kraken attack on the Edinburgh Trader. They needed a huge tentacle to come crashing down and split the ship in half, debris and splinters flying everywhere. Simple enough just to do it in CG, right? But no - *they built a full-scale model ship, towed it out to sea, filled a massive pipe with concrete and dropped it on top!* The only CG in that scene is the actors running around on deck, and even that was composited from footage rather than 100% CG models.

And next time you're watching have a really good look at Davy Jones in any of his scenes. The complexity of his tentacles, the damp textures, the semitransparency of his skin, it's absolutely amazing work.",DarkNinjaPenguin

It was such a great introduction to the characters we'd come to know and love, and to a world we would never want to leave, even as the last credits were rolling. The first three are such good films, (i don't care for the last two. They have their moments, but are nowhere on the same level as the first three.) 

The Curse gave us the first appearance of Jack Sparrow, before he was overused constantly in the next films, and that scene of him arriving on his sinking ship is iconic. Love the scene where Barbossa and his men are walking under the ships at the bottom of the sea, towards the end of the film. 

Davy Jones is my favourite villain, but Barbossa is great in this one. Also the MUSIC! SO GOOD! Whenever you feel down or miserable, listen to 'He's a Pirate', and just try to not feel empowered, I dare you! 

The banter between Jack and Will is great, as is their first duel, actually all the fight scenes are awesome.

ht7w0r,Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is still a super fun movie and holds up pretty well,fygagol,2020-07-18 10:53:15,"What a coincidence, I just finished watching the first three PotC movies! And I gotta say these movies don't become boring.

The first one is really really good, apart from the somewhat janky special effects as you mentioned. But the pacing is great, the humor is great, the music is great, Cpt Jack Sparrow is great.

The second film was always my favorite. I love Bill Nighy's Davy Jones. And good lord those Special Effects look like the movie just came out, even after... 15 years? The ""Johnny Depp does goofy shit"" stuff has been amped up which I personally don't like, but everything else in this movie is a solid +1 compared to the first one.

Now the third one is where it starts to fall apart. It's still really good, Beckett and Davy Jones are great villains, I love me some Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa again, more pirate lore is always good and from a technical standpoint the movie is just as good as the previous two. However it  just drags on for sooo long. It feels like two movies put together. Halfway through I found myself thinking ""well there's only this battle missing and then that's it right? Oh right this plot point. And this one. And this one."" and it just kept going and going just like my explanation does! But the ending battle does feel rewarding and the way the trilogy ends feels natural.

And then they made two more shitty movies! Which I'm not going to re-watch!",egalomon

I enjoyed the original trilogy overall to some extent (though I would say overall all the movies following the first are mediocre) but perhaps the biggest thing wrong with the sequels are the use of Jack Sparrow. He goes from being this sincerely gray character whose actions you can't predict to this zany flanderized comic relief who you know is always on the right side. There's something in the way things pan out in Curse of the Black Pearl where while some of it is dumb luck, some of the the things he does, gets away with, or flat out adapts to show a real sense of cunning and ingenuity that makes the depictions of Jack in the sequels kind of insulting.",Uncanny_Doom

I recently watched a lengthy YouTube video on how good the film is, a lot of the reason it holds up, (besides the perfect cast, perfect score, perfect sets and costume etc.) Is that it's just really efficient story telling, more showing less telling. No huge exposition dump or text crawl in the beginning to explain the world or how it works.

I will often times forget they even made sequels, because I find them to be inferior in almost every way. The fact that Johnny Depp never really captures the performance of Jack Sparrow ever again probably has a lot to do with that.",prismatic_vista

Even though it was once a highest grossing movie. Liked the fifth one though. Not the best compared to the first 3 but wasant that bad either. It got really bad reviews. I guess if it had good reviews then we would still get a better jack sparrow movie. Not a reboot.

If it comes out today it'd get better reviews. It's still not nearly as good as the first 3 though. 

The 5th actually had semi interesting characters (new Will and Elizabeth >>>> the boring af Priest dude and mermaid), Salazar was a cool villain, Jack wasn't perfect by any means but worked better in this than he did 4 because he wasn't the main main character and Barbossa had a good arc. Will was back for a bit, the music was more like the first 3, especially when he and Elizabeth reunite. It was also way shorter which helped a lot i feel.

ht7w0r,Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is still a super fun movie and holds up pretty well,fyg2irb,2020-07-18 08:27:03,"No... it is pretty trivial.

Consider, for example, Infinity War. Thanos is notoriously on screen for more time than any individual character. However, every single one of those appearances is framed from the perspective of another character, except for when he gets the Soul Stone. Thanos racks up more minutes on screen simply because there are about four and a half perspectives (Thor, Tony, Guardians ensemble/Gamora, Earth heroes) that Thanos interacts with whereas those perspectives largely don't interact with each other.

Now, Black Pearl is a little different because, in principle, Will and Jack spend pretty much the entire movie as a tandem so the question is ""how does he get more screen time?"" And the answer is... because he isn't the main character. We see Jack mostly from Will's perspective. The only real exception is the prison scene which, crucially, resolves itself in Will's arrival. I can't see how else Jack ends up with more screentime than Will. There really can't be much in it at all... at least for Black Pearl.

Having lots of screentime doesn't change Jack's function in the film... screentime merely reflects a combination of what's required for the character + the level of interaction with the perspective characters.",FrameworkisDigimon

And what were all those reasons? Honestly in filmmaking it is very difficult to have 6 separate storylines and tell a good story. Most times the film has no focus and so rather then tell 1 or 2 good stories they tell 6 bad ones. Separating the story also hurts development of characters and story.

These idea contradict one another. If killing Jack is the right thing to do, why regret instantly and why bring him back? This is manipulative writing, have a character make a hard choice kill a loved character you get the feels from the audience and then the first thing in the next film bring back Jack, see Jacks OK and Elizabeth isn't a bitch everything is back to normal.

>I don’t think Jack trusts her (or anyone for that matter) is 100%.

Think about this ending. Rather then Will Jones shoots Elizabeth. Will stabs the heart becoming new Captain. The two ships blow up bad guys ship like normal.

Almost all of these storylines aren't perspectives but rather side motives that side characters have. The film is very much about Will and Elizabeth and the complications that Jack's completely selfish desires impose on that relationship.

You're acting like these are main throughlines in the way that Snatch has, let's see, Turkish, Cousin Avi, Sol & buddies and, kind of, Brick Top, Mickey and Boris the Blade. They're not. They're motivations layered in a single story.

Mainly because Infinity War was still a love letter to fans, with some incredible character interactions and fights that fans had only dreamed of in the years leading up to it. The difference was that Infinity War had impeccable pacing and character usage/development, which was crazy for a movie with that amount of main characters. On top of that they essentially introduced and completely developed Thanos.

Endgame? Absolutely perfect opening. But pacing was ruined after that, with most of the movie until the ending battle being mostly talking. Captain America and Iron Man had fantastic character arcs and endings, but they were really the only ones to have any. Hawkeyes was basically handwaved, Hulks happened off screen, Nat died and no one really cared, and Thors happened really quickly and didn't really get an ending (which I hated after his incredible Ragnarok and Infinity War arc). The final battle was a spectacle but lacked the creativity of Infinity War's battles. And Thanos was turned into yet another bland villain leading an army.

Endgame didn't need the constant bombastic set pieces of Infinity War, but to make up for that they really needed to apply the development Iron Man and Cap got to the rest of the core Avengers team.

OK, but that doesn't say anything about cutting out his heart. Yes Will killing Jones makes him Capt, but why cut out the heart?

>Barb dies on land, outside of Davy Jones influence. He was never in the Locker.

Witch also said if you want to bring back Jack you need a Capt who is familiar with those waters.................and out comes Barbosa. Hinting he was there and got out.

>which Calypso and Barbarossa need in order to free her

I didn't ask why they wanted Jack back, I asked about Elizabeth. She just killed him.

>Jack literally only sails with them because they are all stuck in the Locker, not because he wants too.

And after he gets out he literally hands his killer the crown of the pirates. He makes Elizabeth Queen, seems like he trusts her. Why? 

And it's bad writing. End one film with a character making a life altering choice killing Jack and then undoing that is the point of the first part of the 3rd film.

>""Davy jones cannot make port. Cannot step on land but once every ten years. Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow, and so you will carry land with you."" ""...Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.""

It's not some magic Jar of Dirt.

Not close to what Endgame was.

Yes because no one else gets development in the film. This in not a knock on IW, the hero are established and don't need development. But also this is why IW and Endgame need to be part 1 and 2 of one film, you have to carry over Thanos development in IW to Endgame.

>but to make up for that they really needed to apply the development Iron Man and Cap got to the rest of the core Avengers team.

You really can't. This film is already stupid long, we can't add in major development and great endings for 4 other characters and also pump up Thanos's development. Also you claim ""with most of the movie until the ending battle being mostly talking"", adding development and endings for all the core Avengers would add a ton of talking.

Does Jack interfere in Will and Elizabeth relationship?..........no. Will and Elizabeth went looking for Jack of their own free will. You can't say Jack is ""imposing on that relationship"" when they literally went and imposed on his life.

>You know, only tricking him aboard the Flying Dutchman but whatever.

That's not how that happened. You already wrote...""Will makes a deal with Jack to find the key to the chest in return for Jack's compass"" Will needed to be on the Dutchman to get the key. Will being 'tricked' to be on the Dutchman was part of their plan. Did you honestly not get that?

Also, once on the Dutchman Will story completely changes and Jack is no longer important. Jack has nothing to do with Will freeing his dad.

>In Tortuga, Jack hires a new crew, including Elizabeth and Norrington. [...] Jack orders the survivors to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him

Again Jack didn't force Elizabeth on board, she comes looking for him. That's Elizabeth imposing into Jacks life. 

Honestly how do you blame Jack because Cutler arrested Elizabeth and forced Will to get Jack compass? How do you blame Jack when Elizabeth hunts Jack down? They imposed on him, not the other way around.

Might I add, if Will had learned his lesson from Curse of the Black Pearl he should have trusted Jack and everything would have worked out. Jack either forces Jones to do what he wants or Jack kills him and takes power. Either way, Jack frees Bootstrap and then give his compass to Will, Will trades compass for Elizabeth. Everyone wins. But no, Will is poorly written and because of his interference Norrington gets the heart and everything gets worse.

>No, Infinity War is just one of the worst MCU movies whereas Dead Man's Chest is, again, really good.

Cutting out your heart is a part of the curse, because it is what Davy Jones did.

Yah that's not what happened. The curse was broken when Will stabbed the heart, remember the crew turn back into humans from the sea monsters they were. Second the job is not cursed only Jones. Calypso gave Jones the job and NOTHING about getting the job has to do with cutting out your heart. Jones cut out his own heart so he wouldn't feel the pain of heartbreak anymore, that is not connected to the job. How do you not get that? I want to point out these words you said ""cut out his own heart because he thought Calypso had left him and was cursed for it."", your own words Jones was cursed....................not the job.

>And he cant get this familiarity while he was, I don't know, alive?

Didn't seem like he was to familial with the locker.

>Because she felt guilty for her part in his death and was trying to make up for it.

Instantly? If it was so wrong why kill him in the first place.

I mostly bring this up because it's manipulative and bad writing. Good writing: have a character make a difficult choice to kill someone(specifically a loved character) and then have to deal with guilt and the aftermath of her choice. And the audience has to deal with the lose of Jack and Elizabeth's betrayal. Solid story telling. BAD writing immediately in the next movie undoing all that. Literally what you quoted ""Jacks back. Everything is going to be okay now.""..................that is bad bad bad writing.

>Jack votes for her because she is the only one who will sail the fleet out and attack the EITC.

He has to trust her to do that.

>Your nitpicking hard, and entirely about the wrong things.

It's a major plot point. Jack giving her all the power after see killed him is is dumb and bad writing. Elizabeth never really pays a price for her betrayal and thus can't ever have redemption. She did something pretty evil and they sweep it under the rug, this again is bad writing.

Might I point out more clear bad writing for character development. When is Will and Elizabeth ever going to start trusting Jack? They should have learned that lesson after the first film, by they keep f-ing everything up because they don't trust him. The 2nd/3rd films are full of backstabbing and double crossing. But if they just trusted him things would work out. But again bad writing because we will skip character growth because we need to create turmoil.

>Thats extremely subjective.

It's a common hated trope in writing, it's called the resurrection trope, look it up.

>You must hate most books if characters try to undo their past mistakes is poor writing to you.

That would be nice if that is what happens. What great sacrifice does she do to redeem herself? If she was only doing it as part of Barbosa's plan as you hinted it's self serving. Elizabeth never went above and beyond to redeem herself. Bad writing. And it's even worse because it could have been put in.

Try again:

When I write that Will is tricked aboard, what I mean is that Will ends up on a ship thinking one thing but he's actually there for a different, Jack-related, purpose.

No the burden of the argument is on who 'imposed' on whom. Jake did go to Will and Elizabeth. Will and Elizabeth put themselves there. You can't blame Jake when Will and Elizabeth came to him. They imposed on Jack.

They WON’T do it because the _Pirates_ theme park ride is in their “kids” section, and not next to _Tower of Terror_. They think this IP is “kid-friendly” because it’s in the Magic Kingdom, and not Hollywood Studios.

It will get made anyway because if they strategize its release date properly, it will be profitable.

There’s a theory that box office is a result of the quality of a franchise’s last movie, so you can expect very few people to show up for a flailing franchise like Pirates.

The ending with Pirates of the Caribbean dead men tell no tales, had a wonderful ending. I believe there is no reason to do another Pirates of the Caribbean movie.  I will not watch it. If the next generation wants to see an updated version of the Pirates of the Caribbean, I hope the producers have a great screen play written. 
As a young child, I was able to go to Disney land, and experience the ride Pirates of the Caribbean.  I'm sad to hear the ""ride"" at Disney land, has had many Jack sparrow items removed.  I would like to keep the tradition, but life changes generation to generation.  I believe Mr. DEPP put his heart and soul into making these Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Aside from politics, making another Pirates of the Caribbean movie, without Mr. Johnny Depp, would be a waste of time. He was an absolutely great character, even spent his personal time dressing up at hospital's, and Disney Land, to give many people joy. 
I hope Mr. Depp continues to reach others with his talents, most importantly, I want Depp to know,  he's done so much entertaining throughout the last 40 years, and If Mr. Depp wants to play in a band, sing, and be himself find his peace, I absolutely support this.

There's no reason we should be going backwards in terms of CGI quality, but between Ant-Man 3 and The Flash, CGI is looking rough on some of these films when it shouldn't.  It's not the artists' fault, they aren't given suffient time/resources to finish the shots and when every 2nd shot (or every shot) needs CGI, you're hooped.

You're spending $140-200 million making these movies, what is another 10-20 mil to get quality CG work done and you're movie doesn't look like shit.  Also, the quality of these scripts is pretty poor.",JPeeper

And maybe they sometimes think to give them more time and creative freedom to films they deem to be ‘more important’ in the larger scheme of things.   Such as pushing crossovers and cameos, giver tighter deadlines to vfx artists on a film, knowing it will hurt the quality of the film, in order to rush it out this season and set up something further down the pipeline where they can pay off the setup, or branch off to new franchises, or really focus on the quality of vfx on a ‘more important’ film.  Knowing when to pull their top vfx houses and artists to work on projects further down the pipeline and knowing these things might hurt the individual film but not enough so that they’ll loose audience interest when they pay it off further down the line in other projects.     
  
These types of decisions happen all the time.  So I’m wondering if there is ever consideration given to how much ‘goodwill’ so to speak, you have with your audience before you start negatively impacting the perception and interest in the larger franchise as a whole.   Obviously they don’t set out with the intent to make a bad film, but rather they look to where they can better use their limited resources, given how quickly they’re turning around these films.",ReggieCousins

> Oftentimes they are trying to appeal to different groups outside their normal fan base and in doing so hit the wrong tone for their long time fans.  
  
This is actually a good example of a situation where those orders to appeal to larger audience or do things like ‘try to capture all four quadrants’ at the expense of long time fans, might very well not be the ideas of the writer/s themselves but from producers or executives from the studio demanding those criteria be met and it might not necessarily be something the writer wants to do but needs to if they want to have a job.

But I feel like most people's gripes from my experience are that it's not the cgi, the story, the new characters but Jack Sparrows character development.
In the first movie, he may be a bit flamboyant and like a loose cannon but he always has a plan and/or an ulterior motive. With the whole stealing the interceptor scene for example.
But in 2 and 3 he just becomes more and more ridiculous with things just sort of panning out good for him by chance, it's more luck than planning for example the tribe island in 2 and the God damn world's end crab boat thing in 3.

They weren't perfect, not even as good as the first film which was a fun adventure film at best, but they both had something that the latter sequels were sorely missing; ambition. You can tell that the writers and director were truly swinging for the fences and even if they missed more often than not, at least they tried. The 4th film in particular just felt lazy all around compared to those two.

Plus the last hour(ish) of At World's End, while over long, is something of a masterpiece in my mind. Elizabeth's speech, the maelstrom, the fights, the wedding in the middle of the fights, all with some epic Hans Zimmer music, and then the cherry on top of the destruction of Beckett's ship in slow motion.

The director, Gore Verbinski, started off as a visual effects artists himself, so he really knew exactly what was possible and how best to shoot each effects scene to get the most out of his artists.

On top of that, a lot of the effects were practical, rather than pure CG. This made the films *insanely* expensive, but it's what makes them look so great. For example, the scene where the kraken breaks the merchant ship in half? They built a full-scale model ship, filled a pipe with concrete and dropped it on top.

Your first scene shows Will Turner, tasked with ferrying the undead to the afterlife. Then the movie revolves around ghost pirates and Neptune’s trident.

The first three are solid narratively because of the two leads:  Elizabeth and Will. They both have goals and drive and great character development.

Jack is not a main character. He is a plot device. A really damned good plot device, but his character is not suited to serving as the primary protagonist.

Once you lose Elizabeth and Will, and move Jack into the main spot, you lose what made the films work narratively.",TheGentlemanDM

It wasn't just two sides, one trying to destroy it, one defending it, but lots of different characters having different motivations to do either. The amount of planning, crossing, double crossing, making deals, breaking them, stealing, buying, hiding, finding, made it really interesting to follow and try and work out the best outcome for everyone.

That had it's charms but let's not let nostalgia distract us from the fact that the potholes where brutal. 

When they introduced Tia Dalma in Dead Man's Chest she makes comments about Davy Jones that don't make sense by any standard as if the writers at this point didn't know she would be revealed as Calypso. There is a point where a character isn't written as a good liar but appears in retrospect unaware of its own background. 

In fact everything todo with Calypso makes no sense. She has no impact on the story considering her insane power level. She throws a massive temper tantrum in form of a storm but that's it. It's not targetted and there is no further effect. She's not taking revenge she's just making a fancy swirly for the battle to have stakes. It also seems to have no long term effect on the universe that they fucking released a sea god that supposedly made the waters significantly harder to sail for pirates. Calypso isn't just chaotic evil, she's completely confused chaotic evil. She does things. Because she does them. Because she's the sea *it doesn't have to make sense* (were practically getting beaten over the head with the lampshading for lazy writing). 

And Davy Jones villain motive is that he's kinda got hit over the head too. The first part, sure, makes sense, where he gets supposedly betrayed by his godlover that he sold his soul to (!) so he gets a lot of pirates to work together and imprison her (nevermind for a second we're supposed to brush over the fact that he has no reason to know how to do that). But then, after half an eternity of being screwed over and screwing people over because he's still bound to the vow he made to her (and she crapped over hard) all she needs to do is say ""whelp, ya know, I kinda love you but I'll always be an abusive bitch, which you can't be mad about because you should have known"" for him to go ""yeah, makes sense. I love again, notice me senpai."" I've seen octopus solve complex puzzles, so if anyone wants to blame the tentacle brain for this degree of stupid, I'm calling bs.

Calypso was a plot device they did so badly.

EDIT: And i'm sparing you all a similar rant for the whole jack-will-liz triangle that only exists for pointless sexual tension and lovers quarrel. It's completely nonsensical even by teen drama standards and severely hurts the character consistency of Elizabeth.",Quantentheorie

It was a mostly normal and mortal world, and then had this one out of place fantasy element with the cursed pirates to give it a twist. In Curse of the Black Pearl the pirates were just pirates--normal people being debaucherous in Tortuga, in At World's End the pirates are part of a mystical society that can summon an ocean god with a semi-spiritualistic death hymn. If you look up ""jumping the shark,"" the first result should be this movie trilogy.

They were all debating releasing her because they *didn't* know what she was going to do. Some said that she would be grateful. Others said she was still their enemy. Essentially, no agreement was made.  
  
Then Barbossa said 'screw this' and trapped and planned to release Calypso anyway with the intention of ""I'll release her and she'll help me out"". That...*kind of* worked, just not as intended. They did release her but nothing really happened except she caused a storm for the final fight. Hence the 'what now?' from some of the pirates and some replied ""Nothing. It didn't work."" But then Elizabeth was like ""are you fucking kidding me? All this effort gone to waste? Nah bro we're gonna fight to the last breath""  which was *also* the point of the storm-for them to fight it out. And then they beat the dutchman and won the fight.  
  
It was intended to be a ""What now?"" scene. You don't need a goddess giving you buffs beforehand. All you need is a fighting spirit and a reason to fight and you damn well fight to the last breath!

The first movie is about a young naive boy joining up with a smuggler to stop an evil juggernaut with supernatural forces. Smuggler is obsessed with the fastest ship around. They take the ship to do things, implied the smuggler really only cares about money. Boy almost gets the girl (who is essentially a princess) throughout. References to a lineage. Rag tag group take on big evils and the ""empire.""

Second movie Who is my daddy? Meet my Daddy. Get his dagger thing. Also, let's go to a swamp to visit a wise old supernatural being who will tell us about destiny and fate. Boy loses girl to smuggler, smuggler dies...ish in a cliffhanger end...but everyone agrees to go rescue him in the next movie. We mix plots a bit here in that an old bargain by the smuggler is the core issue here, not as much the being chased by the Empire...but both are present. Old smuggling friends brought into the fold (whether Norrington is a Lando substitute is arguable). We also have a weird Ewok crossover here instead of the third movie. So it goes.

Uh oh, big angry Empire is back, let's go get a big coalition of previously unknown but similar anti-Empire folk. Also need to rescue the smuggler. On the way, let's resolve the princess and smuggler romance to get the love triangle out of the way. Big ship battle at the end which seemingly ends the Empire. Boy makes tragic sacrifice (gets the girl sorta...so that's a change), saves father from his supernatural eternal doom. Defeats the bigger grislier evil and becomes the sole weilder of the supernatural power.

* **Beauty and the Beast (2017)** - The Disney train just keeps on rolling as Beauty and the Beast became the 8th movie to ever pass $500M domestic. Now half of the $500M grossers are Disney films with all of them coming out in the last five years (the other three are The Force Awakens, The Avengers, and Rogue One). Disney has clearly cornered the market on domestic sales and could easily see another enter the $500M range with The Last Jedi being released later this year.

* **The Fate of the Furious** - It wasn't just Disney adding a new member to an elite club, as Universal's Fate of the Furious passed $1B in international sales this week. This is just the 6th film to do so and the first time ever two films from a franchise have passed that marker (Furious 7 also made $1B internationally). Also Fate of the Furious has now passed Iron Man 3 in worldwide gross making FotF the 11th highest grossing film of all time. 

**Films not on follow list with updates**

* **Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2** - Guardians 2 has now surpassed the original in both domestic ($333.2M) and worldwide gross ($783.3M). Now the big question is if the film will become the first non-RDJ starring MCU film to crack $1B. 

**Notable film closings**

* **Moonlight** - The very acclaimed and surprise (in more ways than one) Best Picture winner has now closed to an incredible $27.8M domestic and $65M worldwide on a budget of just $1.5M. The film was made on a shoestring budget to the point that Oscar nominee Naomi Harris literally had to film here scenes in just three days. As such the film looked to be closing around $10M or so before the Oscar buzz but nominations and awards helped propel to becoming the highest grossing release for A24, even topping films that played in twice as many theaters like Ex Machina and The VVitch. Moonlight is an undeniable success, one that proves Oscars matter in terms of getting small films like Moonlight seen by much larger audiences. 

* **Your Name** - The little anime that could closed in the US to an incredible $4.8M domestic and $354.3M worldwide on an unknown but likely small budget. The anime was a massive success in both Japan and China where it broke previous animation box office records and become something of a cultural touchstone for youths in both nations. In the US the film didn't quite catch on but it never saw a release of more than 300 theaters and maintained good per theater averages throughout its run. Ultimately US is a blip in comparison to the rest of the world, where the film was a monumental success in multiple countries. 

* **The Belko Experiment** - The latest from Blumhouse closed to a small if solid $10.1M domestic and $10.3M worldwide on a budget of $5M. The film from writer James Gunn received mix reviews but ultimately doubled its budget and likely played well in VOD which is more the goal of the BH Tilt title it was released under. It should be noted this meager sum is actually the second highest gross for BH Tilt which should tell you that meager sums is the name of the game. 

* **CHIPS** - While Baywatch is certainly gunning for it, CHIPS saw an equally awful performance closing to a pathetic $18.6M domestic and $25.5 worldwide on a budget of $25M. The film by Dax Shepard was savaged by critics and could barely even top its small production budget and will almost certainly be a loss Warner Bros. when marketing is counted in. It seems likely the utter failure of this film and Baywatch might put an end to all the 21 Jump St. clones out there. 

* **Ghost in the Shell (2017)** - The controversial anime film closed to a disappointing $40.5M domestic and $169.8M worldwide on a budget of $110M. The film received a lot of criticism for its whitewashing of the main character, even Paramount claiming that's why the film failed. However I think even more at heart is that frankly US audiences don't care about untested properties and that turning a heady anime that's not super well known by mass audiences into an action film just upsets both sides and no one wins. That said certainly GitS will join Exodus: Gods and Kings, Pan, and Gods of Egypt as notably whitewashed movies that were still colossal bombs despite having ""A list"" actors to give them international appeal.

Also, Covenant underperforming is a real shame, that universe could have been so cool if it had gone in another direction. Im a big fan of the first two, and I was going to see it, but.. I just can't get behind where they went with the story. I really liked Prometheus, my feelings are so conflicted on it. It's such a cool and in many ways great sci-fi movie, but they *fucked* up the Alien mythology. No other way to say it. They took the mysterious, creepy and fascinating Bone ship and Space Jockey, and took a huge steaming dump on it with this Engineer garbage. The idea is really cool, if it had been its own story. But setting it in the Alien universe to explain the xeno's, and the derelict etc was a *terrible* idea.

So when the sequel comes along with, let's just say, less then stellar reviews and a protagonist with the screen presence of a wet blanket, I'm sure as hell not going to open my wallet to see it in the cinema.

Which makes me think: why does Ridley Scott, and everybody else for that matter, seem to think he is in any way entitled or even qualified to develop the Alien mythos or whatever you wanna call it.

It gives casual audiences the impression that its quality is based on a hundred point scale when in reality it is a percentage of likes vs dislikes.  There is a vast gulf between like and dislike, however.  Movies that may generally be liked may not be loved, conversely movies that may be disliked may be hated.  For example, John Wick 2 was enjoyable but there were problems that reduced the score for me to an B/80, yet it scored on the Tomatometer similar to The Raid which is a classic.  

Tomatometer is a double edged sword, it's easier to score high - and low, and with casual audiences misperceiving its meaning, exacerbating the feast or famine results at the box office.  For example, I and others who watched King Arthur loved it but the Tomatometer score from reading through its threads scared people off.  I could see how divisive it could be but on balance and with a 1-10 rating system, should've at least been 40 percent (it's a 46 on RT's average critic score, 42 on Metacritic)

Movies are huge bets but RT scores are taking out the middle ground
 which will ultimately result in even fewer risky movies, midrange movies, and more franchises as Hollywood will seek to hedge bets with international ie big budget action.

The solution is already available on RT as it has the average critic scores.  It is this number that should be promoted to more accurately reflect a movie's quality, true gems and bombs will stand out, and the movies in the middle will be up to audiences to decide rather than an all too easy casual dismissal based on a misleading score.

It's funny you mention Sears.  They did fail to adequately adapt and recognize a changing market.   They were the largest retailer and got stuck with a vast amount of real estate that failed to generate revenue (shuttered Sears, Kmart retail stores).  Some of their holdings were converted into data centers.

The current trend for market segmentation will be an unmitigated disaster.  Consumers don't want to pay twenty businesses for 20 services.  Market segmentation offers choices, but often creates too many headaches.

Consumers want to pay one provider a reasonable fee with access to everything or have a choice to pay for what they want.  i.e. a la carte model.

Netflix's success is based on this consumer friendly model with reasonable rates and access to a diverse content library.

Hollywood has been trying to crack the China market for awhile now, but has had a difficult time due to protectionism in China.  The Chinese government has various restrictions on imports.

There are only so many foreign films each year permitted in China.  To get around that restriction, a film must be co-produced with a Chinese company, include Chinese actors, and have a certain amount of production in China.

- Blomkamp is really, really good at VFX. This is just a fact. Even if you found everything after District 9 underwhelming (which I did, too), the technical elements of those films were very well done, especially the action scenes and integrating real actors with CGI components. Everyone seems to agree covenant's CGI was pretty bad in places, I think this is one area where he'd actually be better than Scott.

- Blomkamp's biggest problem has been that he writes his own scripts and he's not as good at that as he thinks he is. In this case, he would have been directing someone else's script so his shitty writing wouldn't have undermined his fantastic VFX work. 

- it would have been a direct continuation of the original films' plot and not a prequel that seems like it was written as an entirely separate franchise and then pasted the Aliens in later for brand recognition

Jack, Will, and Elizabeth SHARED the lead roles in the first trilogy. Don't get me wrong, Depp was undeniably the star, but in terms of screen time and character interactions, all three were the major players in those movies. They balanced each other out, with each character having their own arcs that ultimately carried the trilogy.

But having Jack as the sole lead in the last two films simply isn't as interesting. There's just too much of him now, and every supporting character (even Barbossa) is relegated to simply reacting off of Jack's quirkiness instead of challenging him like Will and Elizabeth constantly did. Everyone likes to rag on the romantic subplot of the first trilogy but it actually took up so little screen time. Shit, Will and Elizabeth spent a majority of the sequels on their own, trying to find each other. In At World's End they were even hostile to one another.

In other words Will and Elizabeth were a central part to what made the trilogy work so well. They just tend to get overlooked because of Depp's ability to steal his scenes and make it look like he was carrying the movies, when that simply wasn't the case at all.",thefablemuncher

But the script is terribly written and the film is horrendously paced and the ""King Arthur"" moments are pretty bad as far as I'm concerned.

The movie kind of reminded me of Suicide Squad, in that it starts out very stylized before losing most of that style later on. The only difference is, Suicide Squad loses it completely, while King Arthur has enough of it popping up occasionally to remind you that a better movie could have existed.

Frankly, I think it would have been better if it wasn't a King Arthur movie at all, or at least not about King Arthur himself. I kept thinking that if this was a movie about how street rats and hoodlums pounced on the opportunities King Arthur's revolution would create to establish themselves as quasi-allies of him while simultaneously becoming climbing ranks in the criminal underworld, we'd have a much more interesting movie.",HopelessCineromantic

It's not a simple thumbs up or down - RT staff check each critic's review and assign it a score to calculate the tomato rating. An official RT movie score means at least 5 critics reviewed it and consider it ""good"". A ""fresh"" movie means it has a RT score of 60%. ""Rotten"" is anything below. Let's say all that means that 5 critics could gave it a 4/5 which results in 100% fresh.

Say there's a movie with where 5 critics rated it a 3/5, and 5 rated it a 4/5, which gives it a 50%. To finesse that score, they could:
- change what it means to be ""good"". If good means 3/5 instead of 4/5, suddenly the score is 100% again
- change what it means to be a critic. If they include a lot more critics than before, they can get the score boosted simply by adding to the pool. Maybe they approve bloggers or YouTube channels who tend to rate movies highly. In this example, adding 3 bloggers with 4/5 ratings turns the good/bad ratio into 8:5, which comes out to 61% - that's fresh!
- change the threshold for certifying a movie as fresh. If they decide 50% of critics is good enough, then suddenly this movie is 100% fresh again.
- change how they internally score reviews. Some critics use star ratings, some use thumbs up/down, some don't give a score at all but simply talk about the movie's successes and failures. There is a lot of room for interpretation there which could easily bump a movie a few percentage points.

They will probably do a combination of all these things. And I have no doubt they will. There have been studies showing that the ratings that Fandango shows in its app are almost always higher than the average of other sources.

Edit: I'm using these numbers just because they're good for the example, but they don't accurately represent how the actual tomatometer works. I believe the general concepts are accurate though.

tl;dr - you can change the variables for an RT score to improve it",nearcatch

The movie is also not really about bay watch. It's a police comedy that happens to be set on the beach. Bay watch was always about lifeguards, not about lifeguards who thought they were cops. 

And as someone else said, the tv show was unintentionally funny. It wasn't a comedy but rather a ""so bad it's funny"" type show that was self aware. The movie tries to be a straight up comedy. 

I'd also say that the BT show had a very strong moral compass and had heart. It was always a little too wholesome.

It was a dramatic-action type show that took itself a little too seriously and wound up unintentionally campy, Hasselhoff's signature move, though I think they were more self-aware and played along with it in later seasons.

That campiness, combined with it's inoffensiveness and clicheed happy-endings-with-heart, gave it a sort of charm that made it an acceptable guilty pleasure. Nobody considered it ground-breaking television, but you weren't necessarily ridiculed for openly admitting to watch it, either.

But the series needs someone else as a lead. They seemed to try and get that in the new one, but both the characters lacked that balance, with their stories revolving around Jack too much. I think it was poor writing.

Hell, the second and third movie could have possibly gone on without Jack. It wouldn't have been as interesting, but could have gone ahead.

The fourth one was even worse, because that was purely ""Jack Sparrow of the Caribbean"", rather than Pirates.

If they do a sixth one, then they need to strengthen the new characters so that there's a balance against Jack.",Peachy_Pineapple

To me it looks like Covenant should be able to roughly break even at worst with its theatrical run, and make it's way to an OK-at-best profit from blu ray sales, merchandise, and what not. It also looks like if they do make another one, getting a big budget is probably not on the table; depending on how the Scott/studio balance of power went in production, they might decide to exert more or less influence as well. And making a sequel at all might just be off the table entirely.

Interestingly, the series has never been a big box office record breaker. Alien and Aliens were very financially successful, but only because they had low production budgets; they brought in about $100m and $130m, respectively. That's very successful for when they came out, but the franchise hasn't really zoomed much past that in the years since. Alien 3 and Resurrection brought in about $160m each, and Prometheus was the most successful by far, at about $400m.

I'd lean towards lowering the budgets to account for the apparent core audience size in order to maintain profitability.",Geistbar

I think the Fast & Furious movies are terrible, but undeniably the thing fans keep coming back for is seeing their favorite characters getting into a story they can follow that puts the characters in fun scenes. That's a pretty starkly different type of characterization from, say, Moonlight. Complex doesn't mean better to a huge portion of the population. The Big Bang Theory pulls way higher numbers than Breaking Bad ever did. But the characters and the story are what people love about both those shows, or the Fast movies, as different as they are. I think they should try to make the next Fast movie for $150M and see if anyone notices. I bet it still does gangbusters as long as the framework is there. ",SetYourGoals

Talent participation deals used to be based on net earnings vs. gross earnings. So some shady companies would try to shield profits from participation deals. But that's long since gone away, agents don't make those deals anymore. Even the most publicized instance of this, Forrest Gump, ended up being a total falsehood, admitted by the author who made the allegation. But only the ""Forrest Gump made no profit!??!?!"" headline sticks in people's heads. 

That's just not how it works. The budgets are out of control. The ideas are bad. It's going to hit critical mass eventually. The tentpole floor is going to fall out. But it's got nothing to do with weird accounting. Just stupid old people running the studios. ",SetYourGoals

It's important to realize they have all been down on their luck and destitute for YEARS prior to the start of the film. Jack has not found a way to free the Pearl, Barbossa rules the sea, immortality has eluded him and he can't even pull off a heist anymore as his plans fail. He's in a bad dark place and is an actual alcoholic at the start of the film. Gibbs is literally starving. The whole movie is about him finding himself and a purpose again.

-That case is Stan Lee suing Marvel **Comics** about a bunch of different properties. It includes Fox movies, Sony movies, Universal movies, etc. Marvel eventually [settled with him,](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/29/business/media/marvel-settles-with-a-spiderman-creator.html), but it's certainly not ""Hollywood accounting."" It's Marvel not paying Lee, not a movie studio.

-New Line was a shitty production company, not a studio, and they settled with Jackson. 

-The Stallone thing we need to hear the WB side of, we've only heard Stallone's complaint, but again, that's one of those 3 decade old deals that they don't make anymore, and seems more like WB Home Ent just fucking up in 1997 and then trying to cover their asses when someone asked about it 20 years later. 

Other big instances that get brought up a lot:

- My Big Fat Greek Wedding - Production company, not studio. And the plaintiffs [dropped that case, with no settlement, and were apparently paid $44M in profit participation as their contract dictated.](http://www.eonline.com/news/20525/hanks-drops-suit-against-greek-wedding-parties)

- Winston Groom + Forrest Gump - ""I wasn't suing Paramount,"" Groom said. ""I had a question about the royalty statement, which I didn't understand. When I spoke to Paramount I was assured everything was OK. I'm delighted with this agreement."" [Source.](http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Gump-Author-Settles-Fight-With-Studio-3031365.php) This quote is a month after that story blew up, and it's still the #1 most cited incidence of ""hollywood accounting."" Even though it's bullshit, the man was paid, and the bigger profit participants were on gross deals, not net. Also that was decades ago.

I've seen some funky things with moving money around from x department to y department, especially with P&A money, depending on where it's advantageous to show profit or loss for the company. But that's not ""hollywood accounting."" Hollywood Accounting is hiding profits in order to fuck people who made participation deals. They don't do that anymore, and I'm not convinced it was widespread 30 years ago. With the rise of CAA and talent power, those deals just don't happen, and the studios would be caught, in court, and no talent would work with them.

That's not how it works? Nobody just wakes and decides not to pay someone. They all sign contracts beforehand. The predatory structuring of the contracts to deny money based on profitability is what I would consider Hollywood accounting. It being a studio or production company isn't really relevant, especially when most movies have production companies created just for the accounting books.

> But people who know nothing about the industry or who are super bitter that they aren't in it

No that's just not what it is. Commonly the term is used only to describe the practice of saying a profitable movie has not made a profit, so that you do not have to pay out profit participation on deals that only kick in at certain profit levels. It's a very specific thing, and it's pretty rare for a production company to be in the position to even commit this. The kinds of talent deals we are talking about are made by the studios the vast majority of the time. The examples you specifically cited were a comic book company sort of doing it and a 30 year old deal pertaining to downstream revenue that we have no idea about the validity of. If this was happening we'd have tons of examples, there would be lawsuits left and right. Don't take my word for it, ask anyone in the industry, especially at a major agency. They wouldn't structure talent deals in a way that even allows this to be a possibility. Maybe they used to, but the talent has power now. 

New Line wasn't a production company created for accounting a movie though. It was one of the largest and most insular production companies, and they were in a particular position of control on LOTR as they had the rights, funded it, etc, not a traditional studio like WB. New Line was a part of Time Warner, but it was still very independent. If I had to guess, Michael Lynne who was COO at New Line, might have unilaterally made the call not to pay out the participations, especially to Jackson. They didn't like Jackson, I think they were mad that he got all the credit, and they were still seen as outsiders by Hollywood. That's what it looks like at least. There's a really good Vanity Fair piece on them from a long time ago that is worth a read, the company has a weird and interesting story. 

And sorry I wasn't saying YOU are super bitter or not in the industry or whatever, sorry if it came off that way, I was typing that quickly running around on my phone. I'm just saying that there's an odd amount of vitriol that comes from people when they are told the ""hollywood accounting"" thing is essentially a trumped up myth. You're smart and having a discussion and clearly open to learning, finding sources, etc. I'm concurrently dealing with a guy who challenging the fact that I even work in the industry, calling me names, etc. Over some ""here's how the business works"" comment I made. It's happened before a couple times too. I've spoken with other people in the industry who post here, and they said they've had the same arguments with angry people over the Hollywood accounting thing. So, my only idea on why they are so angry is that they are bitter about the industry in general, for whatever personal reasons, and they always saw this as a great thing to point to about Hollywood. It's truly odd how resistant people are to this specific idea (and also finding out how the box office returns and film profitability actually works, same reaction a lot of the time). 

I've yet to see a compelling argument that this happens, it wasn't happening at two of the three major studios I've worked at (I couldn't look at accounting info at the third). Accounting firms would meticulously audit us pretty frequently, even the small budgets that I handled. I'm sure some weird shit goes on with the money. Taxes and interest and department shifting. But to think the studios are royally screwing over the major talent on giant tentpole movies (which is where I usually see this brought up) is just not possible. It would be front page news on Deadline every day. ",SetYourGoals

Also Beauty and the Beast passes $500M domestic and Fate of the Furious passes $1B in international sales.",di7wkje,2017-05-30 08:54:19,"When did we agree that I have no qualifications? I've pretty meticulously sifted through the budgets of giant movies at two major studios. I was personally responsible for the accounting on smaller roughly $10M budgets at these studios, but that gave me access to see all the numbers. This stuff interests me so, I looked at as much as I could. 

So the director of Emily Rose says he didn't get any money from a 5% net deal. Assuming he's correct, which he very well may not have been, there are some obstacles to profitability there. Usually those deals are tiered, to start with, so maybe they don't kick in until after X amount of box office or X amount of profit. So say it's 5% of everything after $20M in profit or something. So they don't have big participation, but if it's some Exorcist or Paranormal Activity runaway hit, they get a good piece. That would be pretty standard for a first time director I'd guess, which he was. Then look at the actual box office. The movie probably brought in roughly $37M domestic, and $24M international or so, give or take, so let's call it a $60M return. The production budget was listed at $19M. This had a pretty heft marketing spend I would think, several times the cost of the budget. I looked on Wikileaks, but this movie was too old to have good theatrical profit data on there or the total marketing budget. I did find the marketing budget for Taiwan, which you can see [here](http://i.imgur.com/BtbgVsl.png) or get from Wikileaks with an easy search. $4M in Taiwan alone for marketing, where it made $1,170,319 at the box office. I'd conservatively guess the marketing budget/releasing costs for the US were $35-40M, and maybe the same for the rest of the world combined, hard to know. It could be a lot higher but I'm being conservative for the sake of argument here. 

Now we're looking at a lot more than $60M in costs. So...yes, it's very possible that they did not turn a theatrical profit on the movie, in fact it seems likely that they didn't. I'm sure they hit profitability with TV and this was the heyday of DVD, but I'm not sure a first time director would have any downstream participation. 

Sounds like a case where the guy just had a bad deal, and the movie didn't make any money in theaters, and they spent way too much on marketing back then. 

The Harry Potter thing is just internal weird bookkeeping for WB. They paid themselves a distribution fee, moved money, etc. But if they were fucking people over with this, as people like to imply, the second this document hit deadline they'd be up to their eyes in lawsuits from the cast and producers. Who gives a shit what their internal system is? Also, looking at that doc, this looks like it's just a distribution sheet. Where is the production budget? That was reportedly $150M. And they they spent $131M just on the ad buys. $60M more in other smaller marketing and fee costs. And they got $460M in box office returns, based on this document. I'll admit I don't get a ton about distribution costs, they've always been very separate from anything I've done, but it isn't exactly insane that there weren't overwhelming profits from a movie they spent $350M to make and got $460M in box office. They made $100M, they moved money, minimized taxes, etc. That's corporations. Why do you or anyone have a problem with this unless it's screwing over the talent? You have a problem with the entire idea of corporate accounting? Hollywood Accounting means a pretty specific thing. Shielding the studio from having to pay net participation deals by erroneously showing no profits. 

I agree corporate accounting is batshit crazy, I don't think companies like the studios, or Apple or any other huge company, should get to avoid taxes with loopholes. But that's not what people are talking about when they scream ""Hollywood Accounting!"" The common definition just isn't something that's going on in the modern entertainment industry. ",SetYourGoals

I think one of the biggest problems (that each Pirates movie built on) is the development of the three main characters. In Curse, Jack is not the main protagonist. He’s the sidekick foil to Will. And yes, he does have some goofy moments, but in Curse he’s much more of a clever, conniving character. Each movie subsequently made him dumber, goofier, and more clearly “the main character”. Will is the traditional hero of Curse, going through a hero arc and realizing that pirates aren’t all bad. He’s stubborn and naive, but also caring and brave. The sequels mostly just have him around for action and the “save Dad vs marry Elizabeth” choice. Elizabeth gets more of an arc in the sequels, but they don’t build much on her initial character. She remains stubborn, headstrong, and adventurous, while getting into more and more crazy situations. Honestly, Norrington and Davy Jones have the best character development in the sequels. 

TLDR: I still really like DMC and AWE, but I think a big reason people like CotBP so much is the characters.",cooperthetrooper

Pirates 1 motivations are pretty straight forward:

* Jack: Wants the Black Pearl and generally money
* Will: Wants to save Elizabeth
* Norington: Wants to save Elizabeth and marry her
* Barbossa & Crew: Wants the curse lifted

Pirates 2 and 3 motivations get a lot more complex and alliances shift over the course of the films:

* Jack: Wants to get out of his deal with Davy Jones and never die
* Will: Wants to get his dad back from Davy Jones
* Elizabeth: Wants a pardon so they can live happily ever after
* Davy Jones: Just doing his job and pissed at Calypso
* Norington: Wants to get his station back and regain honor
* Gibbs & Crew: Wants to survive and make $
* Bootstrap Bill: Wants to save his son
* Capt Feng: Wants to release Calypso
* Tia Dalma: Wants to be released I guess
* Cutler Beckett: Wants to rule the seas by controlling Davy Jones

Bootstrap Bill gave a frightening tale to Jack that this man has the *Kraken* working for him, of all things. If the Reaper of the seas is coming to collect your soul, he'll be intimidating for sure. It's a lot of work to get a CGI character right, and in 2006 they did a phenomenal job. Thinking about it now, just two years later we got the first Iron Man, and I still love the CGI in that movie. I know with how complicated the MCU is now, they basically made Iron Man's last suit iterations nanotech and much more ""fluid"" so that the CGI would probably be simpler, but I really love going back and seeing how much effort went into the first suit (I'm pretty sure they made an actual model of his suit), and the weight felt pretty believable.

Then those 2, Norrington & Jack go on a hunt for Davy's chest to gain control of it for their own reasons. jack wants to call the kraken off, Will wants to free his father and Norrinton wants to send it to Beckett to gain his status back in the Navy.

*At World's End* is clearly a conclusion. Just like *Return of the Jedi* is a conclusion, or like how *Matrix Revolutions* is a conclusion. You shouldn't have yet another sequel after the conclusion.

Some movies aren't resolutions in the usual sense, but are a kind of good farewell to the characters, like *Toy Story 3* or *The Last Crusade*, and yet they too get further sequels.

In the first film, all of those characters' subplots all tied into the central plot. While they do in the sequel, as well, that central plot is more a MacGuffin than a story. It's a bunch of independent threads coming together because of the chest, but so much of those threads requires a ton of exposition which makes the film feel overstuffed. The first film was *The Black Pearl* crew's motivation against the motivations of the other parties to save Elizabeth (Will and Norrington) or save their ship (Jack and the other pirates) - since those opposing Barbosa all have a goal that lends to each other, it flows so much more naturally. 

In *Dead Man's Chest*, it's ""I wanna free my Daddy,"" ""I wanna save my fiancé (even though I'm doubting I want to),"" ""I'm not sure what I want, but I wanna not be killed by the Kraken,"" ""I don't want these fuckers to stab my heart,"" and ""I'm not sure what I want, but, hey, everyone else wants this thing, so I must want it too."" No one really shares any motivations, so it's a juggle. This movie starts the clusterfuck of backstabbing that makes the cup flow over in the third film. It's all engineered drama, where the first excelled at the characters' all sharing a motivation while having different goals - the sequel is different goals *and* different motivations, but driven to claim the same solution. It just doesn't land as well.",axlkomix

On the other hand, my favorite Star Wars movie, RotJ, is also long, and generally not slow, until you get to Endor and things basically stop progressing for about 30 minutes while they fuck around in the forest.

To me, Pirates 4 felt like a continuation that was at least hinted at after At World's End. I know it's hard for the movie to feel as much like a Pirates movie because the trilogy was wrapped up nicely and ended some important character arcs. It's a good thing they didn't bring them back (looking at you 5), but at the same time I can't deny I'm biased with 4 because I'm a fan of Barbossa.

I know everyone loves Jack Sparrow but I personally loved Hector Barbossa more as a character. He just feels like the most pirate-y pirate out of them all, and in a way Pirates 4 is basically seeing Barbossa go through the same arc Jack did in the first Pirates movie. We don't see him reduced to something weak, instead we see Barbossa conquering his newfound weakness and going for revenge against a notoriously feared pirate.

cg4wmb,Fun Fact: Kiera Knightley was only 17 during the the recording of Pirates of the Caribbean,euktjjz,2019-07-23 14:42:44,"> ""Elizabeth herself is a person who is clearly more “modern” than most of her peers such as with her attitudes about marriage for love and her family quick judgements early in the book.""

Elizabeth's someone who's ahead of her time in various ways but she still abides by the proper etiquette and address and all that and I not only don't get that from Knightley, I don't get the supposedly more passionate Elizabeth either that everybody believes her to be. When Ehle laughs and her true self breaks through, I see that fire in her that makes her more similar to her mother than she'd care to admit, for instance. With Knightley it's overboard, she acts uber modern so much it's almost impossible for me to suspend my disbelief. It's just so far removed from how Elizabeth would be in reality in my opinion that I can't buy into her. 

But mind you a lot of this is also down to her appearance as well which is why I mentioned cosplaying earlier. I could almost  understand where Caroline was coming from during the scene in which Elizabeth gets all muddy unlike in the miniseries where she's completely out of line, and you're so obviously not supposed to side with her.

Most films released between the mid 2000s until very recently, regardless of whether they were shot on film or digital, went through a 2K digital post-production process. On the 4K releases, unless it's film and they do a re-scan, you're gonna get an upscale. But that upscale can do a few things. 1080p is slightly less resolution than 2K, so there's that already, but also 4K discs allow for much stronger compression and better resolution for fine details, so it's completely possible for a 4K release to have better detail than a blu-ray. Then there's the HDR factor, which alone can improve an image in big ways if deployed right. Hell, for all the problems with the new LotR 4K releases, the HDR basically makes them worthwhile all on their own. Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2K upscale, and it looks absolutely terrific (though some have noted that the flames can occasionally look slightly wonky in HDR).

As for being a lot of work. Honestly, it's not that much work if you're doing a straight upscale. The work comes in the HDR grade, which isn't nothing, but if you're trying to sell some 4K discs and iTunes purchases, it can be worth it for a studio to undertake.",cupofteaonme

Often it's just a matter of what's affordable. 2K is cheaper to scan, and quite a bit cheaper to work with in terms of restoration. But it's also often a matter of how well the source film stands up to scanning. A lot of those martial arts movies were done in a 35mm format that used half the frame, and thus don't actually have as much detail to resolve, so 2K is really all you need. Would 4K be better? Technically, sure, but you're not necessarily gonna get an improvement significant enough to justify it. And you're almost definitely not going to get an improvement big enough to justify a whole new scan and restoration. Could they upscale that 2K and try to add an HDR grade? Sure. But again... the expense.

There are also examples like Kino's UHD release of The Good the Bad and the Ugly, which is in 4K, but without HDR. And apparently that's because the film elements they were dealing with, while detailed enough to warrant a 4K scan and restoration, didn't have enough latitude in the dynamic range to work well with HDR.

A similar thing happened recently with the Blu-ray release of the British movie Censor, which was shot with a variety of formats, mostly film, but with some digital as well. It was originally announced as getting a 4K release with HDR, but as it turned out, the DI had been done in 2K, which already makes it just an upscale, and apparently the DI had been done in such a way that it couldn't accommodate HDR very well, so they cancelled the 4K release and are just putting it out on regular Blu-ray.",cupofteaonme

Either way, they do not appear to be based on new scans.

>Except for the guys who actually, y'know, made the 4K transfer.

Nobody involved in the production of the discs has said that the 4K releases were made from brand new film scans, so I'm not sure what you're referring to.

**Edit:** I see you're a big fan of ninja edits. For the record, every time there is a new scan done, the texture of the image will look slightly different, and this will be clear even through the DNR. This is because scanners are different from each other, never mind a change in resolution of the scan. While the 4K image has clearly been remastered on the newer releases, with new colour grading and DNR and all that jazz, it does not appear to have been sourced from a new scan.

Furthermore, there is more DNR applied to the effects shots than the non-effects shots, so the notion that it was to make everything match is silly. In fact, an easier way to make everything match would have been to add *more* grain to the effects shots so that they look more appropriately filmic, rather than scrubbing the grain so it looks waxy and smeary in motion, with artificial sharpening that actually makes the effects composites look worse in some cases.

Truth is, with this release there are two separate things going on. The first is that they did an upscale and remastering of pre-existing scans. This on its own wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. The second thing is that Jackson has become enamoured of digital smoothing in general, seen in his recent documentaries, and in this release. That second thing is where the real trouble arises. While it's unfortunate we couldn't get full new scans of the negatives and film-outs, there's a universe in which the upscaling method was used with an intention to maintain the trilogy's filmic look. Instead, Jackson went the other direction, making a trio of 35mm-shot films look more digital. Not totally digital. They still do look basically like film. But seriously futzed with.

The transfer will still be 1080p, and more importantly it’ll be compressed to fit on the disc, and some discs will be compressed well and some won’t. On a 4K TV, the TV will often do some sort of upscaling to 4K, and certain blu-ray players or UHD players will offer their own intelligent upscaling as well. The results are usually good, but they’re always going to work better if the source is better. So a poorly compressed blu-ray may show some ugly artifacts when upscaling is added, while well compressed blu-rays look nicely improved. You will actually see this phenomenon more often with 1080p streaming content on a 4K TV, where if it’s badly compressed it can sometimes actually look worse than if you’d just watched on a 1080p TV.

Thanks for explaining what, exactly, generates the noise. The fact that it's called ""noise"" when there is no picture and ""grain"" by useless geeks like yourself when there is a picture does not change the simple fact that the grain is, literally, noise. Shoot a still scene with film, what does the grain do? Do those crystals align up in precisely the same way frame to frame, so it is indistinguishable from a still photo? No, it moves completely randomly, changing entirely from one frame to the next. This is literally the textbook definition of noise.

Can you point me to where in that press release it is stated that new scans were done?

The quote you got is from Gizmodo, and I'm going to assume they aggregated the info from Bill Hunt at [The Digital Bits](https://thedigitalbits.com/columns/my-two-cents/100720-0900), who wrote upon the official announcement of the release in 2020:

>All six films have been fully remastered by Weta Digital in New Zealand in a process overseen by director Peter Jackson. For The Lord of the Rings, this includes new 4K scans of original camera negative and new 4K scans of the original VFX film outs. The Hobbit films were shot digitally in 5K.

Until Dune, I'd only heard of it being done on experimental films.

Grain also isn't ""essential"" to the film experience. It is simply a natural component of anything shot on film, because the image is literally made up of grain, similar to digital images being made up of pixels. Some filmmakers will choose to shoot on film in a way that accentuates the grain, while others will seek a less grainy image by shooting with more light or a larger gauge film stock. It can be an artistic choice. A lot of movies shot digitally will have a layer of grain added in the DI, because overly sharp (not detailed, but sharp) images don't always look super pleasing, or might not match the filmmaker's intended look.

Don't read too much into it. Same goes for Toy Story 4 to support the new rides in Pixarland and why Star Wars will be supported for a while longer before going into hiatus due to Galaxy's Edge.

Other movies to expect due to themepark expansions:

Moana 2, Zootopia 2 and Frozen 3 as Epcot & Disney Hong Kong / Shanghai start diversifying away from the Magic Kingdom model. Expect big Spiderman and Avengers news in 2021 or so to coincide with the new Avengers academy thing around the world.

d3hvz3,True or False: The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise should have ended with At World's End,f03mhez,2019-09-13 07:44:46,"What made the first three great was their overarching story and themes (I loved the circle/cyclical motif in almost all the fight scenes, which tied in nicely with most of the main characters' fates). The fourth movie should have started another trilogy, but it and the fifth were just standalone movies with the typical villain of the day plot.

I would rank the first three in this order:

1. Dead Man's Chest - this is when the actors/actresses really honed their respective characters and made them fun to watch. The action sequences were hilarious, the dialogue was witty, and Davy Jones was a great villain who I could relate to at the time. Also Sparrow's ""sacrifice"" at the end was a great scene. Verbinski did a great job integrating all the characters from the first movie, even the most minor and static, and making them funny dynamic characters in the following movies.

2. Curse of the Black Pearl - solid movie throughout.

3. At World's End - In my opinion the weakest of the three. The tone was weird, it was not fun/adventurous at all, too much traveling on boats. but it tied up everything nicely.",peatear_gryphon

Have the characters remain the same and drive the drama, but Davy Jones was not as compelling an antagonist as they thought, IMO, and *At* *World's* *End* was boring and it's ending was so out of left field because of their desperate attempts to make the ""universe"" of these movies too connected.",Mrallen7509

A fun fantasy pirate movie every x years is fine by me. The problem is they put everything on Jack Sparrow and ignored Will and Elizabeth.

How can you not do something cool with Will running the Dutchman?

The last movie set up a whole trilogy only to completely ruin everything by finding the macguffin 10 minutes after setting out on a journey for it and getting rid of all curses which were the hook of the whole franchise. They did absolutely nothing with Will and the Dutchman after using it in marketing to hype it up as a return to form. Absolute shit. 

I wanted the Dutchman to fight the ghost ship. Now we get nothing and Will is back to a normal dude again.

I think the trilogy should have been Curse of the Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest and At World's End combined into one movie (emphasis on At World's End), and Dead Men Tell No Tales as the ending. Stranger Tides should simply be forgotten, as it just introduced half a dozen new pointless characters who did nothing to deepen the story of the world or the few remaining original characters. Though, Cruz was a badass and Ian McShane made a delightful Blackbeard.

The problem with At World's End is that despite being the second best film in the franchise, it left too many aspect of the story unfinished, most importantly Will and Elizabeth, and Jack's search for immortality. And while Stranger Tides did little to answer those questions, DMTNT did, and gave us an ending that neatly, albeit not as entertainingly, explained why there's no more magic on the high seas, effectively ending these magic pirate stories and Jack's quest.

As per the change to Jack's character in the last two films, by then most of the magic of Depp's performance seemed lost, likely owing to him feeling tired of the role.

d3hvz3,True or False: The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise should have ended with At World's End,f03p1r9,2019-09-13 08:43:00,"For me, and I know this is unpopular because I've offered it here before, but I feel a big issue is that Will and Elizabeth (in Black Pearl) are one of the simplest and sweetest romances in blockbuster film. They are both _adorable_, in a film that is ultimately about their character arcs - the two of them undergoing change as a result of meeting a static, unchanging character in Jack Sparrow. As the romance was sidelined more and more in sequels, it became harder for the audience to care about the characters. By the time Disney realized the mistake, it was too late to try and bring them back to center.

As great as Depp is playing Jack, you can't have a real interesting story arc or character development if the whole film was just him. He's a comedic character, and sure he has a backstory that gives him motive, but his arc is really just him acting on that motive. It'd be a Charlie Chaplin movie, but with sound - that doesn't work in this day and age. You don't believe he's going become a good heroic person, he will always be an antihero, but you also don't fear that anything is going to happen to him.

None of these considerations show through with focus testing, and Depp is so spectacular that the conclusion is that he carries the franchise. Black Pearl was very clearly made to be a stand-alone film, but with it's success two more were ordered - and that's where the wheels fall off. 

The first film wrapped up too solidly for sequels. Despite the ending being a bunch of pirates hitting the open seas for adventure, it really is the happy ever after moment where everybody gets what they wanted most: Will gets Elizabeth, Elizabeth gets freedom, and Jack gets the Pearl. Jack even talks about his dream of basically sailing off into the sunset. But they had to build the franchise, tell some story, so they went with the only connection between the first film and a potential expansion of the story - Will's dad. 

It worked okay. But it got strange. Elizabeth signaled that maybe she and Will were complicated. Will ended up being a sea monster. A goddess gets released in the same film where the East India Company makes it seem like the days of piracy are ending. Barbossa is brought back. Kung Fu pirates. And Jack is still a weirdly developed character throughout. 

I think World's End was the end of the Will/Elizabeth story, which is why Stranger Tides did so well at the box office. Will was incredibly bland as a character, because the first film is all he was really developed for. Of course, Tides was as convoluted as any of the films that came before it, critics hated it, and Disney did the dumbest thing possible by trying to bring back Will Turner - and Davy Jones. 

Between Jack cheating death a million times, Barbossa and Jones both cheating on-screen death, and Will continually being a part of the stories, the franchise has made it impossible to take death seriously. It's like old action cartoons from the 80s, like Transformers and GI Joe, where good and evil are constantly throwing down but nobody ever dies.",None

d3hvz3,True or False: The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise should have ended with At World's End,f05a17p,2019-09-13 20:05:52,"Stranger tides completely ruined the character in the first 15 minutes. It's most glaring in the scene in the beginning in the banquet hall with Barbossa and the guards are trying to capture Jack and he kicks the pastry into the chandelier and blocks the guards guns so they shoot the chandelier ropes and it swings so he can hang on it and escape, but not before grabbing the pastry from it. That's just utterly contrived bullshit and goes completely against the character that was set up in 1-3.

Sure, some of the moments in 1-3 were a little ridiculous, but they still plausibly fell somewhere between 'dumb luck' and 'did he plan that?' which is what made his character great.

The banquet scene is just pure fake unbelievable garbage. Since it's the same writers I can only blame it on the change in director/choreographer. Gore Verbinski kept the essence of the character in check and without him it was lost.

But yeah like others say, his character is hard to maintain when he's the focal point of the movie. He works best as a sleight of camera character when the camera has other priorities, but that's hard when he's the main character.",orderinthefort
